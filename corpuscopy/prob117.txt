G. Grid Game
Claire loves drawing lines. She receives a sheet of paper with an n×n grid and begins drawing "lines" on it. Well—the concept of a "line" here is not what we usually think of. Claire refers each line to be a set of consecutive vertical grid cells. When she draws a line, these cells are all covered with black ink. Initially, all the cells are white, and drawing lines turns some of them black. After drawing a few lines, Claire wonders: how many ways she can color an additional white cell black so that the remaining white cells do not form a single connected component.
Two cells are directly connected if they share an edge. Two cells x and y are indirectly connected if there exists a sequence of cells c0,c1,…,ck with k>1 such that c0=x, ck=y, and for every i∈{1,2,…,k} the cells ci and ci−1 are directly connected. A set of cells forms a single connected component if each pair of cells in the set is either directly or indirectly connected.
The grid has n rows and n columns, both indexed from 1 to n. Claire will draw q lines. The i-th line is drawn in the yi-th column, from the si-th row to the fi-th row, where si≤fi for each i∈{1,2,…,q}. Note that the cells that are passed by at least one of the q lines are colored black. The following figure shows an example of a 20×20 grid with q=67 lines. The grid cells marked with red star symbols refer to the cells such that, if Claire colors that cell black, all white cells no longer form a single connected component.
You may assume that, after drawing the q lines, the remaining white cells form a single connected component with at least three white cells.
