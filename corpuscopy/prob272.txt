B. Brightness Begins
Imagine you have n light bulbs numbered 1,2,…,n. Initially, all bulbs are on. To flip the state of a bulb means to turn it off if it used to be on, and to turn it on otherwise.
Next, you do the following:
  - for each i=1,2,…,n, flip the state of all bulbs j such that j is divisible by i†.
After performing all operations, there will be several bulbs that are still on. Your goal is to make this number exactly k.
Find the smallest suitable n such that after performing the operations there will be exactly k bulbs on. We can show that an answer always exists.
† An integer x is divisible by y if there exists an integer z such that x=y⋅z.
