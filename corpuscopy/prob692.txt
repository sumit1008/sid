D. Buying Jewels
Alice has n coins and wants to shop at Bob's jewelry store. Today, although Bob has not set up the store yet, Bob wants to make sure Alice will buy exactly k jewels. To set up the store, Bob can erect at most 60 stalls (each containing an unlimited amount of jewels) and set the price per jewel for each stall to be an integer number of coins between 1 and 1018.
Fortunately, Bob knows that Alice buys greedily: and she will go to stall 1, buy as many jewels as possible, then go to stall 2, buy as many jewels as possible, and so on until the last stall. Knowing this, Bob can choose the number of stalls to set up, as well as set the price for each stall so that Alice buys exactly k jewels. Help Bob fulfill the task, or determine if it is impossible to do so.
Note that Alice does not need to spend all her coins.
