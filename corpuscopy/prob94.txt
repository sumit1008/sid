F. Easy Demon Problem
For an arbitrary grid, Robot defines its beauty to be the sum of elements in the grid.
Robot gives you an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ and an array $$$b$$$ of length $$$m$$$. You construct a $$$n$$$ by $$$m$$$ grid $$$M$$$ such that $$$M_{i,j}=a_i\cdot b_j$$$ for all $$$1 \leq i \leq n$$$ and $$$1 \leq j \leq m$$$.
Then, Robot gives you $$$q$$$ queries, each consisting of a single integer $$$x$$$. For each query, determine whether or not it is possible to perform the following operation exactly once so that $$$M$$$ has a beauty of $$$x$$$:
Note that queries are not persistent, meaning that you do not actually set any elements to $$$0$$$ in the process — you are only required to output if it is possible to find $$$r$$$ and $$$c$$$ such that if the above operation is performed, the beauty of the grid will be $$$x$$$. Also, note that you must perform the operation for each query, even if the beauty of the original grid is already $$$x$$$.
