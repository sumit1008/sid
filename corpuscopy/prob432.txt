B. Parity and Sum
Given an array a of n positive integers.
In one operation, you can pick any pair of indexes (i,j) such that ai and aj have distinct parity, then replace the smaller one with the sum of them. More formally:
  - If ai<aj, replace ai with ai+aj;
  - Otherwise, replace aj with ai+aj.
Find the minimum number of operations needed to make all elements of the array have the same parity.
