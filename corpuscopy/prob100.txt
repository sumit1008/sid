G. Problem with Queries
You are given an array a, consisting of n integers. Your task is to process q queries of two types:
  - 1 p x — set the value of the element at index p equal to x;
  - 2 l r — count the number of pairs of indices (i,j) such that l≤i<j≤r and ai≠aj.
Note that the queries in this task are encoded; each subsequent query can only be decoded after calculating the answer to the preceding query of the second type.
