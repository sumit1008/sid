D. Longest Max Min Subsequence
You are given an integer sequence a1,a2,…,an. Let S be the set of all possible non-empty subsequences of a without duplicate elements. Your goal is to find the longest sequence in S. If there are multiple of them, find the one that minimizes lexicographical order after multiplying terms at odd positions by −1.
For example, given a=[3,2,3,1], S={[1],[2],[3],[2,1],[2,3],[3,1],[3,2],[2,3,1],[3,2,1]}. Then [2,3,1] and [3,2,1] would be the longest, and [3,2,1] would be the answer since [−3,2,−1] is lexicographically smaller than [−2,3,−1].
A sequence c is a subsequence of a sequence d if c can be obtained from d by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.
A sequence c is lexicographically smaller than a sequence d if and only if one of the following holds:
  - c is a prefix of d, but c≠d;
  - in the first position where c and d differ, the sequence c has a smaller element than the corresponding element in d.
