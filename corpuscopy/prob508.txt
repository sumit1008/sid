D. Swap Dilemma
Given two arrays of distinct positive integers a and b of length n, we would like to make both the arrays the same. Two arrays x and y of length k are said to be the same when for all 1≤i≤k, xi=yi.
Now in one move, you can choose some index l and r in a (l≤r) and swap al and ar, then choose some p and q (p≤q) in b such that r−l=q−p and swap bp and bq.
Is it possible to make both arrays the same?
