H. 378QAQ and Core
378QAQ has a string s of length n. Define the core of a string as the substring† with maximum lexicographic‡ order.
For example, the core of "bazoka" is "zoka", and the core of "aaa" is "aaa".
378QAQ wants to rearrange the string s so that the core is lexicographically minimum. Find the lexicographically minimum possible core over all rearrangements of s.
† A substring of string s is a continuous segment of letters from s. For example, "defor", "code" and "o" are all substrings of "codeforces" while "codes" and "aaa" are not.
‡ A string p is lexicographically smaller than a string q if and only if one of the following holds:
  - p is a prefix of q, but p≠q; or
  - in the first position where p and q differ, the string p has a smaller element than the corresponding element in q (when compared by their ASCII code).
For example, "code" and "coda" are both lexicographically smaller than "codeforces" while "codeforceston" and "z" are not.
