D. Permutation Game
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation 𝑝1,…,𝑝𝑛p1,…,pn and an array 𝑎1,…,𝑎𝑛a1,…,an. They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".
A permutation of length 𝑛n is an array consisting of 𝑛n distinct integers from 11 to 𝑛n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4][2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2][1,2,2] is not a permutation (22 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4][1,3,4] is also not a permutation (𝑛=3n=3 but there is 44 in the array).
Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.
The game lasts 𝑘k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn, two things happen to each player:
  - If the current position of the player is 𝑥x, his score increases by 𝑎𝑥ax.
  - Then the player either stays at his current position 𝑥x or moves from 𝑥x to 𝑝𝑥px.
The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly
turns.
Knowing Bodya's starting position 𝑃𝐵PB and Sasha's starting position 𝑃𝑆PS, determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.
