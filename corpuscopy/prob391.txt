B. Card Game
Suneet and Slavic play a card game. The rules of the game are as follows:
  - Each card has an integer value between 11 and 1010.
  - Each player receives 22 cards which are face-down (so a player doesn't know their cards).
  - The game is turn-based and consists exactly of two turns. In a round, both players pick a random unflipped card and flip it. The player who flipped a card with a strictly greater number wins the round. In case of equality, no one wins the round.
  - A player wins a game if he wins the most number of rounds (i.e. strictly greater than the other player). In case of equality, no one wins the game.
Since Suneet and Slavic aren't best friends, you need to calculate the number of ways the game could happen that Suneet would end up as the winner.
