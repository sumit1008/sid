E. No Palindromes
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. You need to partition† this string into some substrings, such that each substring is not a palindrome‡.
† A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings t1,t2,…,tk, such that t1+t2+…+tk=s, where + here represents the concatenation operation.
‡ A string s is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards as forwards. For example, racecar, abccba, and a are palindromes, but ab, dokibird, and kurosanji are not.
