E. Matrix Transformation
You are given two matrices A and B of size n×m, filled with integers between 0 and 109. You can perform the following operations on matrix A in any order and any number of times:
  - &=: choose two integers i and x (1≤i≤n, x≥0) and replace each element in row i with the result of the bitwise AND operation between x and that element. Formally, for every j∈[1,m], the element Ai,j is replaced with Ai,j & x;
  - |=: choose two integers j and x (1≤j≤m, x≥0) and replace each element in column j with the result of the bitwise OR operation between x and that element. Formally, for every i∈[1,n], the element Ai,j is replaced with Ai,j | x.
The value of x may be chosen differently for different operations.
Determine whether it is possible to transform matrix A into matrix B using the given operations any number of times (including zero).
