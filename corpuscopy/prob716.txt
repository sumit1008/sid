E. Clique Partition
You are given two integers, n𝑛 and k𝑘. There is a graph on n𝑛 vertices, numbered from 11 to n𝑛, which initially has no edges.
You have to assign each vertex an integer; let ai𝑎𝑖 be the integer on the vertex i𝑖. All ai𝑎𝑖 should be distinct integers from 11 to n𝑛.
After assigning integers, for every pair of vertices (i,j)(𝑖,𝑗), you add an edge between them if |i−j|+|ai−aj|≤k.
Your goal is to create a graph which can be partitioned into the minimum possible (for the given values of n and k) number of cliques. Each vertex of the graph should belong to exactly one clique. Recall that a clique is a set of vertices such that every pair of vertices in it are connected with an edge.
Since BledDest hasn't really brushed his programming skills up, he can't solve the problem "given a graph, partition it into the minimum number of cliques". So we also ask you to print the partition itself.
