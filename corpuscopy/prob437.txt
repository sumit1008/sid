D. Test of Love
ErnKor is ready to do anything for Julen, even to swim through crocodile-infested swamps. We decided to test this love. ErnKor will have to swim across a river with a width of 11 meter and a length of n meters.
The river is very cold. Therefore, in total (that is, throughout the entire swim from 0 to n+1) ErnKor can swim in the water for no more than k meters. For the sake of humanity, we have added not only crocodiles to the river, but also logs on which he can jump. Our test is as follows:
Initially, ErnKor is on the left bank and needs to reach the right bank. They are located at the 0 and n+1 meters respectively. The river can be represented as n segments, each with a length of 1 meter. Each segment contains either a log 'L', a crocodile 'C', or just water 'W'. ErnKor can move as follows:
  - If he is on the surface (i.e., on the bank or on a log), he can jump forward for no more than m (1≤m≤10) meters (he can jump on the bank, on a log, or in the water).
  - If he is in the water, he can only swim to the next river segment (or to the bank if he is at the n-th meter).
  - ErnKor cannot land in a segment with a crocodile in any way.
Determine if ErnKor can reach the right bank.
