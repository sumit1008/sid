E. Coloring Game
This is an interactive problem.
Consider an undirected connected graph consisting of n vertices and m edges. Each vertex can be colored with one of three colors: 1, 2, or 3. Initially, all vertices are uncolored.
Alice and Bob are playing a game consisting of n rounds. In each round, the following two-step process happens:
Alice wins if there exists an edge connecting two vertices of the same color. Otherwise, Bob wins.
You are given the graph. Your task is to decide which player you wish to play as and win the game.
