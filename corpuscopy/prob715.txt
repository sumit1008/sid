F. Rare Coins
There are n bags numbered from 1 to n, the i-th bag contains ai golden coins and bi silver coins.
The value of a gold coin is 1. The value of a silver coin is either 0 or 1, determined for each silver coin independently (0 with probability 12, 1 with probability 12).
You have to answer q independent queries. Each query is the following:
  - l r — calculate the probability that the total value of coins in bags from l to r is strictly greater than the total value in all other bags.
