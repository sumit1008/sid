D. Tandem Repeats?
You are given a string s, consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks.
A tandem repeat is a string of an even length such that its first half is equal to its second half.
A string a is a substring of a string b if a can be obtained from b by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end.
Your goal is to replace each question mark with some lowercase Latin letter in such a way that the length of the longest substring that is a tandem repeat is maximum possible.
