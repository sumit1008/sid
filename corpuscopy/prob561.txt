C. Chamo and Mocha's Array
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Chamo gave her an array a consisting of n positive integers as a gift.
Mocha doesn't like arrays containing different numbers, so Mocha decides to use magic to change the array. Mocha can perform the following three-step operation some (possibly, zero) times:
Suppose a=[1,2,3,4,5] initially:
  - If Mocha chooses (l,r)=(3,4) in the first operation, then x=3, the array will be changed into a=[1,2,3,3,5].
  - If Mocha chooses (l,r)=(1,3) in the first operation, then x=2, the array will be changed into a=[2,2,2,4,5].
Mocha will perform the operation until the array contains only the same number. Mocha wants to know what is the maximum possible value of this number.
† The median in an array b of length m is an element that occupies position number ⌊m+12⌋ after we sort the elements in non-decreasing order. For example, the median of [3,1,4,1,5] is 3 and the median of [5,25,20,24] is 20.
