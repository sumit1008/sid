C. Showering
As a computer science student, Alex faces a hard challenge — showering. He tries to shower daily, but despite his best efforts there are always challenges. He takes s minutes to shower and a day only has m minutes!
He already has n tasks planned for the day. Task i is represented as an interval (li, ri), which means that Alex is busy and can not take a shower in that time interval (at any point in time strictly between li and ri). No two tasks overlap.
Given all n time intervals, will Alex be able to shower that day? In other words, will Alex have a free time interval of length at least s?
