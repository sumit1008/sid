B. 378QAQ and Mocha's Array
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, 378QAQ gave her an array a consisting of n positive integers as a gift.
Mocha thinks that a is beautiful if there exist two numbers i and j (1≤i,j≤n, i≠j) such that for all k (1≤k≤n), ak is divisible† by either ai or aj.
Determine whether a is beautiful.
† x is divisible by y if there exists an integer z such that x=y⋅z.
