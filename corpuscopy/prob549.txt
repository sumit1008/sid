F. Remove Bridges
You are given a rooted tree, consisting of n vertices, numbered from 1 to n. Vertex 1 is the root. Additionally, the root only has one child.
You are asked to add exactly k edges to the tree (possibly, multiple edges and/or edges already existing in the tree).
Recall that a bridge is such an edge that, after you remove it, the number of connected components in the graph increases. So, initially, all edges of the tree are bridges.
After k edges are added, some original edges of the tree are still bridges and some are not anymore. You want to satisfy two conditions:
  - for every bridge, all tree edges in the subtree of the lower vertex of that bridge should also be bridges;
  - the number of bridges is as small as possible.
Solve the task for all values of k from 1 to nâˆ’1 and output the smallest number of bridges.
