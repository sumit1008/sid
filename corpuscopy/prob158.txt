B. Intercepted Inputs
To help you prepare for your upcoming Codeforces contest, Citlali set a grid problem and is trying to give you a n by m grid through your input stream. Specifically, your input stream should contain the following:
  - The first line contains two integers n and m — the dimensions of the grid.
  - The following n lines contain m integers each — the values of the grid.
However, someone has intercepted your input stream, shuffled all given integers, and put them all on one line! Now, there are k integers all on one line, and you don't know where each integer originally belongs. Instead of asking Citlali to resend the input, you decide to determine the values of n and m yourself.
Output any possible value of n and m that Citlali could have provided.
