F. Kosuke's Sloth
Kosuke is too lazy. He will not give you any legend, just the task:
Fibonacci numbers are defined as follows:
  - f(1)=f(2)=1.
  - f(n)=f(n−1)+f(n−2) (3≤n)
We denote
as an index of the
-th Fibonacci number that is divisible by
. For given
and
, compute
.
As this number can be too big, output it by modulo 109+7.
For example: G(3,2)=9 because the 3-rd Fibonacci number that is divisible by 2 is 34. [1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34].
