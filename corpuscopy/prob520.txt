D. Turtle and Multiplication
Turtle just learned how to multiply two integers in his math class, and he was very excited.
Then Piggy gave him an integer n𝑛, and asked him to construct a sequence a1,a2,…,an𝑎1,𝑎2,…,𝑎𝑛 consisting of integers which satisfied the following conditions:
  - For all 1≤i≤n1≤𝑖≤𝑛, 1≤ai≤3⋅1051≤𝑎𝑖≤3⋅105.
  - For all 1≤i<j≤n−11≤𝑖<𝑗≤𝑛−1, ai⋅ai+1≠aj⋅aj+1𝑎𝑖⋅𝑎𝑖+1≠𝑎𝑗⋅𝑎𝑗+1.
Of all such sequences, Piggy asked Turtle to find the one with the minimum number of distinct elements.
Turtle definitely could not solve the problem, so please help him!
