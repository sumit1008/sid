A. Chess For Three
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.
In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 22 points while the loser gets 00, and in case of a draw, both players get 11 point each. Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at all.
You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were 𝑝1p1, 𝑝2p2 and 𝑝3p3. Additionally, it is guaranteed that 𝑝1≤𝑝2≤𝑝3p1≤p2≤p3 holds.
Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If there isn't any way to obtain 𝑝1p1, 𝑝2p2 and 𝑝3p3 as a result of a non-negative number of games between the three players, print −1−1 instead.
