I1. Kevin and Puzzle (Easy Version)
This is the easy version of the problem. The difference between the versions is that in this version, you need to find any one good array. You can hack only if you solved all versions of this problem.
Kevin is visiting the Red Church, and he found a puzzle on the wall.
For an array $$$ a $$$, let $$$ c(l,r) $$$ indicate how many distinct numbers are among $$$ a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r $$$. In particular, if $$$ l > r $$$, define $$$ c(l,r) = 0 $$$.
You are given a string $$$ s $$$ of length $$$ n $$$ consisting of letters $$$ \texttt{L} $$$ and $$$ \texttt{R} $$$ only. Let a non-negative array $$$ a $$$ be called good, if the following conditions hold for $$$ 1 \leq i \leq n $$$:
  - if $$$s_i=\verb!L!$$$, then $$$c(1,i-1)=a_i$$$;
  - if $$$s_i=\verb!R!$$$, then $$$c(i+1,n)=a_i$$$.
If there is a good array $$$a$$$, print any of the good arrays. Otherwise, report that no such arrays exists.
