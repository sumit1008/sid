A. Dual Trigger
There are n lamps numbered 1 to n lined up in a row, initially turned off. You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
  - Choose two non-adjacent† lamps that are currently turned off, then turn them on.
Determine whether you can reach configuration s, where si=1 means the i-th lamp is turned on, and si=0 otherwise.
† Only lamp i and i+1 are adjacent for all 1≤i<n. Note that lamp n and 1 are not adjacent when n≠2.
