D. Genokraken
This is an interactive problem.
Upon clearing the Waterside Area, Gretel has found a monster named Genokraken, and she's keeping it contained for her scientific studies.
The monster's nerve system can be structured as a tree† of n nodes (really, everything should stop resembling trees all the time…), numbered from 0 to n−1, with node 0 as the root.
Gretel's objective is to learn the exact structure of the monster's nerve system — more specifically, she wants to know the values p1,p2,…,pn−1 of the tree, where pi (0≤pi<i) is the direct parent node of node i (1≤i≤n−1).
She doesn't know exactly how the nodes are placed, but she knows a few convenient facts:
  - If we remove root node 0 and all adjacent edges, this tree will turn into a forest consisting of only paths‡. Each node that was initially adjacent to the node 0 will be the end of some path.
  - The nodes are indexed in a way that if 1≤x≤y≤n−1, then px≤py.
  - Node 1 has exactly two adjacent nodes (including the node 0).
Gretel can make queries to the containment cell:
  - "? a b" (1≤a,b<n, a≠b) — the cell will check if the simple path between nodes a and b contains the node 0.
However, to avoid unexpected consequences by overstimulating the creature, Gretel wants to query at most 2n−6 times. Though Gretel is gifted, she can't do everything all at once, so can you give her a helping hand?
†A tree is a connected graph where every pair of distinct nodes has exactly one simple path connecting them.
‡A path is a tree whose vertices can be listed in the order v1,v2,…,vk such that the edges are (vi,vi+1) (1≤i<k).
