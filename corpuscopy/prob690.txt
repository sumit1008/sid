F. Inversion Composition
You are given a permutation p of size n, as well as a non-negative integer k. You need to construct a permutation q of size n such that inv(q)+inv(q⋅p)=k†‡, or determine if it is impossible to do so.
† For two permutations p and q of the same size n, the permutation w=q⋅p is such that wi=qpi for all 1≤i≤n.
‡ For a permutation p of size n, the function inv(p) returns the number of inversions of p, i.e. the number of pairs of indices 1≤i<j≤n such that pi>pj.
