D. Robert Hood and Mrs Hood
Robin's brother and mother are visiting, and Robin gets to choose the start day for each visitor.
All days are numbered from 11 to n. Visitors stay for d continuous days, all of those d days must be between day 1 and n inclusive.
Robin has a total of k risky 'jobs' planned. The i-th job takes place between days li and ri inclusive, for 1≤i≤k. If a job takes place on any of the d days, the visit overlaps with this job (the length of overlap is unimportant).
Robin wants his brother's visit to overlap with the maximum number of distinct jobs, and his mother's the minimum.
Find suitable start days for the visits of Robin's brother and mother. If there are multiple suitable days, choose the earliest one.
