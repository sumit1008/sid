D. Non Prime Tree
You are given a tree with n vertices.
You need to construct an array a1,a2,…,an of length n, consisting of unique integers from 1 to 2⋅n, and such that for each edge ui↔vi of the tree, the value |aui−avi| is not a prime number.
Find any array that satisfies these conditions, or report that there is no such array.
