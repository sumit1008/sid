D. Prime XOR Coloring
You are given an undirected graph with 𝑛n vertices, numbered from 11 to 𝑛n. There is an edge between vertices 𝑢u and 𝑣v if and only if 𝑢⊕𝑣u⊕v is a prime number, where ⊕⊕ denotes the bitwise XOR operator.
Color all vertices of the graph using the minimum number of colors, such that no two vertices directly connected by an edge have the same color.
