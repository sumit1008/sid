G2. Min-Fund Prison (Medium)
In the medium version, 2≤∑n≤3002≤∑𝑛≤300 and 1≤∑m≤3001≤∑𝑚≤300
After a worker's strike organized by the Dementors asking for equal rights, the prison of Azkaban has suffered some damage. After settling the spirits, the Ministry of Magic is looking to renovate the prison to ensure that the Dementors are kept in check. The prison consists of n𝑛 prison cells and m𝑚 bi-directional corridors. The ith𝑖𝑡ℎ corridor is from cells ui𝑢𝑖 to vi𝑣𝑖. A subset of these cells S𝑆 is called a complex if any cell in S𝑆 is reachable from any other cell in S𝑆. Formally, a subset of cells S𝑆 is a complex if x𝑥 and y𝑦 are reachable from each other for all x,y∈S𝑥,𝑦∈𝑆, using only cells from S𝑆 on the way. The funding required for a complex S𝑆 consisting of k𝑘 cells is defined as k2𝑘2.
As part of your Intro to Magical Interior Design course at Hogwarts, you have been tasked with designing the prison. The Ministry of Magic has asked that you divide the prison into 22 complexes with exactly one corridor connecting them, so that the Dementors can't organize union meetings. For this purpose, you are allowed to build bi-directional corridors. The funding required to build a corridor between any 2 cells is c.
Due to budget cuts and the ongoing fight against the Death Eaters, you must find the minimum total funding required to divide the prison as per the Ministry's requirements or −1 if no division is possible.
Note: The total funding is the sum of the funding required for the 2 complexes and the corridors built. If after the division, the two complexes have x and y cells respectively and you have built a total of a corridors, the total funding will be x2+y2+c×a. Note that x+y=n.
