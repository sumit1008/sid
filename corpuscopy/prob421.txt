F. Stardew Valley
Pelican Town represents n houses connected by m bidirectional roads. Some roads have NPCs standing on them. Farmer Buba needs to walk on each road with an NPC and talk to them.
Help the farmer find a route satisfying the following properties:
  - The route starts at some house, follows the roads, and ends at the same house.
  - The route does not follow any road more than once (in both directions together).
  - The route follows each road with an NPC exactly once.
Note that the route can follow roads without NPCs, and you do
need to minimize the length of the route.
It is guaranteed that you can reach any house from any other by walking on the roads with NPCs only.
