D. Cool Graph
You are given an undirected graph with $$$n$$$ vertices and $$$m$$$ edges.
You can perform the following operation at most $$$2\cdot \max(n,m)$$$ times:
  - Choose three distinct vertices $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, and $$$c$$$, then for each of the edges $$$(a,b)$$$, $$$(b,c)$$$, and $$$(c,a)$$$, do the following:   If the edge does not exist, add it. On the contrary, if it exists, remove it.
  - If the edge does not exist, add it. On the contrary, if it exists, remove it.
A graph is called cool if and only if one of the following holds:
  - The graph has no edges, or
  - The graph is a tree.
You have to make the graph cool by performing the above operations. Note that you can use at most $$$2\cdot \max(n,m)$$$ operations.
It can be shown that there always exists at least one solution.
