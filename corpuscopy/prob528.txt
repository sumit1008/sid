D. GCD-sequence
GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of two integers x and y is the maximum integer z by which both x and y are divisible. For example, GCD(36,48)=12, GCD(5,10)=5, and GCD(7,11)=1.
Kristina has an array a consisting of exactly n positive integers. She wants to count the GCD of each neighbouring pair of numbers to get a new array b, called GCD-sequence.
So, the elements of the GCD-sequence b will be calculated using the formula bi=GCD(ai,ai+1) for 1≤i≤n−1.
Determine whether it is possible to remove exactly one number from the array a so that the GCD sequence b is non-decreasing (i.e., bi≤bi+1 is always true).
For example, let Khristina had an array a = [20,6,12,3,48,36]. If she removes a4=3 from it and counts the GCD-sequence of b, she gets:
  - b1=GCD(20,6)=2
  - b2=GCD(6,12)=6
  - b3=GCD(12,48)=12
  - b4=GCD(48,36)=12
The resulting GCD sequence
= [
] is non-decreasing because
