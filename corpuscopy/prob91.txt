H. Hard Demon Problem
Swing is opening a pancake factory! A good pancake factory must be good at flattening things, so Swing is going to test his new equipment on 2D matrices.
Swing is given an n×n matrix M containing positive integers. He has q queries to ask you.
For each query, he gives you four integers x1, y1, x2, y2 and asks you to flatten the submatrix bounded by (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) into an array A. Formally, A=[M(x1,y1),M(x1,y1+1),…,M(x1,y2),M(x1+1,y1),M(x1+1,y1+1),…,M(x2,y2)].
The following image depicts the flattening of a submatrix bounded by the red dotted lines. The orange arrows denote the direction that the elements of the submatrix are appended to the back of A, and A is shown at the bottom of the image.
Afterwards, he asks you for the value of ∑|A|i=1Ai⋅i (sum of Ai⋅i over all i).
