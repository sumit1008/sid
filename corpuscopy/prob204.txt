F. Orangutan Approved Subarrays
Suppose you have an array b. Initially, you also have a set S that contains all distinct elements of b. The array b is called orangutan-approved if it can be emptied by repeatedly performing the following operation:
  - In one operation, select indices l and r (1≤l≤r≤|b|) such that v=bl=bl+1=…=br and v is present in S. Remove v from S, and simultaneously remove all bi such that l≤i≤r. Then, reindex the elements br+1,br+2,… as bl,bl+1,… accordingly.
You are given an array a of length n and q queries.
Each query consists of two indices l and r (1≤l≤r≤n), and you need to determine whether or not the subarray al,al+1,…,ar is orangutan-approved.
