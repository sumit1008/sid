G. Milky Days
Little John is as little as night is day — he was known to be a giant, at possibly 2.12.1 metres tall. It has everything to do with his love for milk.
His dairy diary has 𝑛n entries, showing that he acquired 𝑎𝑖ai pints of fresh milk on day 𝑑𝑖di. Milk declines in freshness with time and stays drinkable for a maximum of 𝑘k days. In other words, fresh milk acquired on day 𝑑𝑖di will be drinkable between days 𝑑𝑖di and 𝑑𝑖+𝑘−1di+k−1 inclusive.
Every day, Little John drinks drinkable milk, up to a maximum of 𝑚m pints. In other words, if there are less than 𝑚m pints of milk, he will drink them all and not be satisfied; if there are at least 𝑚m pints of milk, he will drink exactly 𝑚m pints and be satisfied, and it's a milk satisfaction day.
Little John always drinks the freshest drinkable milk first.
Determine the number of milk satisfaction days for Little John.
