D. Penchick and Desert Rabbit
Dedicated to pushing himself to his limits, Penchick challenged himself to survive the midday sun in the Arabian Desert!
While trekking along a linear oasis, Penchick spots a desert rabbit preparing to jump along a line of palm trees. There are n trees, each with a height denoted by ai.
The rabbit can jump from the i-th tree to the j-th tree if exactly one of the following conditions is true:
  - j<i and aj>ai: the rabbit can jump backward to a taller tree.
  - j>i and aj<ai: the rabbit can jump forward to a shorter tree.
For each i from 1 to n, determine the maximum height among all trees that the rabbit can reach if it starts from the i-th tree.
