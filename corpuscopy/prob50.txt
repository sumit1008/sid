You are given an array a of length n. In one operation, you can pick an index i from 2 to n−1 inclusive, and do one of the following actions:
  - Decrease ai−1 by 1, then increase ai+1 by 1.
  - Decrease ai+1 by 1, then increase ai−1 by 1.
After each operation, all the values must be non-negative. Can you make all the elements equal after any number of operations?
