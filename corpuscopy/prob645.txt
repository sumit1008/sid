C. Firewood
It's pretty cold in Berland (yes, even in May). So Monocarp has to light his fireplace.
Monocarp has a big log of wood, which weighs 2n grams. Monocarp has watched the weather forecast and decided that he has to burn k grams of wood in the fireplace today, and the remaining 2n−k grams of wood will be used tomorrow.
In one minute, Monocarp can use his saw to split one of his logs in half. Initially he has only one log, but of course, after splitting a log, he gets two new logs. If the weight of the log is x, then each of the resulting logs has weight equal to x2. Monocarp can't split logs of weight 1 gram.
Monocarp has to cut his log in such a way that some of the resulting logs weigh exactly k grams in total (and since the total weight of wood doesn't change, the remaining logs will have a total weight equal to exactly 2n−k). Help him to calculate the minimum number of minutes he has to spend cutting the logs.
