H1. Cool Swap Walk (Easy Version)
This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference is the maximum number of operations you can perform. You can only make hacks if both versions are solved.
You are given an array a of size n.
A cool swap walk is the following process:
  - In an n×n grid, we note the cells in row i and column j as (i,j). You need to walk from (1,1) to (n,n), taking only steps to the right or down.
  - Formally, if you are in (x,y) currently, you can step to either (x+1,y) or (x,y+1), but you can not step beyond the boundaries of the grid.
  - When you step in (i,j), you must swap ai and aj when i≠j.
You can perform at most 2n+4 cool swap walks. Sort the array a1,a2,…,an in non-decreasing order. We can show that it's always possible to do so.
