A. Dora's Set
Dora has a set s containing integers. In the beginning, she will put all integers in [l,r] into the set s. That is, an integer x is initially contained in the set if and only if l≤x≤r. Then she allows you to perform the following operations:
  - Select three distinct integers a, b, and c from the set s, such that gcd(a,b)=gcd(b,c)=gcd(a,c)=1†.
  - Then, remove these three integers from the set s.
What is the maximum number of operations you can perform?
†Recall that gcd(x,y) means the greatest common divisor of integers x and y.
