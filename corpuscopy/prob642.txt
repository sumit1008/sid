F. Narrow Paths
Monocarp is wandering through a matrix consisting of 22 rows and n columns. Let's denote the cell in the i-th row and j-th column as (i,j). Monocarp starts at cell (1,1) and wants to reach cell (2,n).
In one move, Monocarp can move in one of two directions:
  - right — from cell (i,j) to cell (i,j+1);
  - down — from cell (i,j) to cell (i+1,j).
Monocarp can't go outside the matrix.
Polycarp wants to prevent Monocarp from freely wandering through the matrix. To do this, he wants to choose exactly k different cells in the matrix and block them. He cannot choose cells (1,1) and (2,n).
For each i from 0 to n, Polycarp wants to know how many ways he can block exactly k cells, so that Monocarp has exactly i different paths from (1,1) to (2,n). Two paths are considered different if there exists a cell that Monocarp visits in one path but not in the other.
As the number of ways can be quite large, output it modulo 109+7.
