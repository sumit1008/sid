C. Turtle and an Incomplete Sequence
Turtle was playing with a sequence a1,a2,…,an consisting of positive integers. Unfortunately, some of the integers went missing while playing.
Now the sequence becomes incomplete. There may exist an arbitrary number of indices i such that ai becomes −1. Let the new sequence be a′.
Turtle is sad. But Turtle remembers that for every integer i from 1 to n−1, either ai=⌊ai+12⌋ or ai+1=⌊ai2⌋ holds for the original sequence a.
Turtle wants you to help him complete the sequence. But sometimes Turtle makes mistakes, so you need to tell him if you can't complete the sequence.
Formally, you need to find another sequence b1,b2,…,bn consisting of positive integers such that:
  - For every integer i from 1 to n, if a′i≠−1, then bi=a′i.
  - For every integer i from 1 to n−1, either bi=⌊bi+12⌋ or bi+1=⌊bi2⌋ holds.
  - For every integer i from 1 to n, 1≤bi≤109.
If there is no sequence b1,b2,…,bn that satisfies all of the conditions above, you need to report −1.
