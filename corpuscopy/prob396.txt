C. Perform Operations to Maximize Score
You are given an array a of length n and an integer k. You are also given a binary array b of length n.
You can perform the following operation at most k times:
  - Select an index i (1≤i≤n) such that bi=1. Set ai=ai+1 (i.e., increase ai by 1).
Your score is defined to be max, where c_i denotes the array of length n-1 that you get by deleting a_i from a. In other words, your score is the maximum value of a_i + \operatorname{median}(c_i) over all i from 1 to n.
Find the maximum score that you can achieve if you perform the operations optimally.
For an arbitrary array p, \operatorname{median}(p) is defined as the \left\lfloor \frac{|p|+1}{2} \right\rfloor-th smallest element of p. For example, \operatorname{median} \left( [3,2,1,3] \right) = 2 and \operatorname{median} \left( [6,2,4,5,1] \right) = 4.
