D. "a" String Problem
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. Count the number of nonempty strings t≠ "a" such that it is possible to partition† s into some substrings satisfying the following conditions:
  - each substring either equals t or "a", and
  - at least one substring equals t.
† A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings t1,t2,…,tk (called substrings) such that t1+t2+…+tk=s, where + represents the concatenation operation.
