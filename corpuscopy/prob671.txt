E. Chain Reaction
There are n monsters standing in a row. The i-th monster has ai health points.
Every second, you can choose one alive monster and launch a chain lightning at it. The lightning deals k damage to it, and also spreads to the left (towards decreasing i) and to the right (towards increasing i) to alive monsters, dealing k damage to each. When the lightning reaches a dead monster or the beginning/end of the row, it stops. A monster is considered alive if its health points are strictly greater than 0.
For example, consider the following scenario: there are three monsters with health equal to [5,2,7], and k=3. You can kill them all in 4 seconds:
  - launch a chain lightning at the 3-rd monster, then their health values are [2,−1,4];
  - launch a chain lightning at the 1-st monster, then their health values are [−1,−1,4];
  - launch a chain lightning at the 3-rd monster, then their health values are [−1,−1,1];
  - launch a chain lightning at the 3-th monster, then their health values are [−1,−1,−2].
For each k from 1 to max(a1,a2,…,an), calculate the minimum number of seconds it takes to kill all the monsters.
