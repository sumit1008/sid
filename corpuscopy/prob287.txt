F. Sheriff's Defense
The folk hero Robin Hood has been troubling Sheriff of Nottingham greatly. Sheriff knows that Robin Hood is about to attack his camps and he wants to be prepared.
Sheriff of Nottingham built the camps with strategy in mind and thus there are exactly n camps numbered from 1 to n and nâˆ’1 trails, each connecting two camps. Any camp can be reached from any other camp. Each camp i has initially ai gold.
As it is now, all camps would be destroyed by Robin. Sheriff can strengthen a camp by subtracting exactly c gold from each of its neighboring camps and use it to build better defenses for that camp. Strengthening a camp doesn't change its gold, only its neighbors' gold. A camp can have negative gold.
After Robin Hood's attack, all camps that have been strengthened survive the attack, all others are destroyed.
What's the maximum gold Sheriff can keep in his surviving camps after Robin Hood's attack if he strengthens his camps optimally?
Camp a is neighboring camp b if and only if there exists a trail connecting a and b. Only strengthened camps count towards the answer, as others are destroyed.
