B. Rudolf and 121
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n.
In one operation, he can choose an index i (2≤i≤n−1) and assign:
  - ai−1=ai−1−1
  - ai=ai−2
  - ai+1=ai+1−1
Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used zero or more times.
Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?
