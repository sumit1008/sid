A. Shape Perimeter
There is an 𝑚m by 𝑚m square stamp on an infinite piece of paper. Initially, the bottom-left corner of the square stamp is aligned with the bottom-left corner of the paper. You are given two integer sequences 𝑥x and 𝑦y, each of length 𝑛n. For each step 𝑖i from 11 to 𝑛n, the following happens:
  - Move the stamp 𝑥𝑖xi units to the right and 𝑦𝑖yi units upwards.
  - Press the stamp onto the paper, leaving an 𝑚m by 𝑚m colored square at its current position.
Note that the elements of sequences 𝑥x and 𝑦y have a special constraint: 1≤𝑥𝑖,𝑦𝑖≤𝑚−11≤xi,yi≤m−1.
Note that you do not press the stamp at the bottom-left corner of the paper. Refer to the notes section for better understanding.
It can be proven that after all the operations, the colored shape on the paper formed by the stamp is a single connected region. Find the perimeter of this colored shape.
