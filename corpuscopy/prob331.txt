B. Index and Maximum Value
After receiving yet another integer array a1,a2,…,an at her birthday party, Index decides to perform some operations on it.
Formally, there are m operations that she is going to perform in order. Each of them belongs to one of the two types:
  - + l r. Given two integers l and r, for all 1≤i≤n such that l≤ai≤r, set ai:=ai+1.
  - - l r. Given two integers l and r, for all 1≤i≤n such that l≤ai≤r, set ai:=ai−1.
For example, if the initial array a=[7,1,3,4,3], after performing the operation + 2 4, the array a=[7,1,4,5,4]. Then, after performing the operation - 1 10, the array a=[6,0,3,4,3].
Index is curious about the maximum value in the array a. Please help her find it after each of the m operations.
