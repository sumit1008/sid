C. Cat, Fox and Double Maximum
Fox loves permutations! She came up with the following problem and asked Cat to solve it:
You are given an even positive integer n and a permutation† p of length n.
The score of another permutation q of length n is the number of local maximums in the array a of length n, where ai=pi+qi for all i (1≤i≤n). In other words, the score of q is the number of i such that 1<i<n (note the strict inequalities), ai−1<ai, and ai>ai+1 (once again, note the strict inequalities).
Find the permutation q that achieves the maximum score for given n and p. If there exist multiple such permutations, you can pick any of them.
† A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).
