H. Division Avoidance
A newly discovered organism can be represented as a set of cells on an infinite grid. There is a coordinate system on the grid such that each cell has two integer coordinates 𝑥x and 𝑦y. A cell with coordinates 𝑥=𝑎x=a and 𝑦=𝑏y=b will be denoted as (𝑎,𝑏)(a,b).
Initially, the organism consists of a single cell (0,0)(0,0). Then zero or more divisions can happen. In one division, a cell (𝑎,𝑏)(a,b) is removed and replaced by two cells (𝑎+1,𝑏)(a+1,b) and (𝑎,𝑏+1)(a,b+1).
For example, after the first division, the organism always consists of two cells (1,0)(1,0) and (0,1)(0,1), and after the second division, it is either the three cells (2,0)(2,0), (1,1)(1,1) and (0,1)(0,1), or the three cells (1,0)(1,0), (1,1)(1,1) and (0,2)(0,2).
A division of a cell (𝑎,𝑏)(a,b) can only happen if the cells (𝑎+1,𝑏)(a+1,b) and (𝑎,𝑏+1)(a,b+1) are not yet part of the organism. For example, the cell (1,0)(1,0) cannot divide if the organism currently consists of the three cells (1,0)(1,0), (1,1)(1,1) and (0,2)(0,2), since the cell (1,1)(1,1) that would be one of the results of this division is already part of the organism.
You are given a set of forbidden cells (𝑐𝑖,𝑑𝑖)(ci,di). Is it possible for the organism to contain none of those cells after zero or more divisions?
