H. Rayan vs. Rayaneh
Rayan makes his final efforts to win Reyhaneh's heart by claiming he is stronger than Rayaneh (i.e., computer in Persian). To test this, Reyhaneh asks Khwarizmi for help. Khwarizmi explains that a set is integer linearly independent if no element in the set can be written as an integer linear combination of the others. Rayan is given a set of integers each time and must identify one of the largest possible integer linearly independent subsets.
Note that a single element is always considered an integer linearly independent subset.
An integer linearly combination of a1,…,ak is any sum of the form c1⋅a1+c2⋅a2+…+ck⋅ak where c1,c2,…,ck are integers (which may be zero, positive, or negative).
