A. Painting the Ribbon
Alice and Bob have bought a ribbon consisting of n parts. Now they want to paint it.
First, Alice will paint every part of the ribbon into one of m colors. For each part, she can choose its color arbitrarily.
Then, Bob will choose at most k parts of the ribbon and repaint them into the same color (he chooses the affected parts and the color arbitrarily).
Bob would like all parts to have the same color. However, Alice thinks that this is too dull, so she wants to paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.
Is it possible to paint the ribbon in such a way?
