B. Make Three Regions
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. Each cell of the grid is either free or blocked.
A free cell y is reachable from a free cell x if at least one of these conditions holds:
  - x and y share a side;
  - there exists a free cell z such that z is reachable from x and y is reachable from z.
A connected region is a set of free cells of the grid such that all cells in it are reachable from one another, but adding any other free cell to the set violates this rule.
For example, consider the following layout, where white cells are free, and dark grey cells are blocked:
There are 3 regions in it, denoted with red, green and blue color respectively:
The given grid contains at most 1 connected region. Your task is to calculate the number of free cells meeting the following constraint:
  - if this cell is blocked, the number of connected regions becomes exactly 3.
