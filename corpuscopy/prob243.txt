B. Binomial Coefficients, Kind Of
Recently, akshiM met a task that needed binomial coefficients to solve. He wrote a code he usually does that looked like this:
Unfortunately, he made an error, since the right formula is the following:
But his team member keblidA is interested in values that were produced using the wrong formula. Please help him to calculate these coefficients for t various pairs (ni,ki). Note that they should be calculated according to the first (wrong) formula.
Since values C[ni][ki] may be too large, print them modulo 109+7.
