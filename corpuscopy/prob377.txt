H. Ksyusha and the Loaded Set
Ksyusha decided to start a game development company. To stand out among competitors and achieve success, she decided to write her own game engine. The engine must support a set initially consisting of 𝑛n distinct integers 𝑎1,𝑎2,…,𝑎𝑛a1,a2,…,an.
The set will undergo 𝑚m operations sequentially. The operations can be of the following types:
  - Insert element 𝑥x into the set;
  - Remove element 𝑥x from the set;
  - Report the 𝑘k-load of the set.
The 𝑘k-load of the set is defined as the minimum positive integer 𝑑d such that the integers 𝑑,𝑑+1,…,𝑑+(𝑘−1)d,d+1,…,d+(k−1) do not appear in this set. For example, the 33-load of the set {3,4,6,11}{3,4,6,11} is 77, since the integers 7,8,97,8,9 are absent from the set, and no smaller value fits.
Ksyusha is busy with management tasks, so you will have to write the engine. Implement efficient support for the described operations.
