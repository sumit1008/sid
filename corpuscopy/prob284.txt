A. Cards Partition
You have some cards. An integer between 1 and n is written on each card: specifically, for each i from 1 to n, you have ai cards which have the number i written on them.
There is also a shop which contains unlimited cards of each type. You have k coins, so you can buy at most k new cards in total, and the cards you buy can contain any integer between 1 and n, inclusive.
After buying the new cards, you must partition all your cards into decks, according to the following rules:
  - all the decks must have the same size;
  - there are no pairs of cards with the same value in the same deck.
Find the maximum possible size of a deck after buying cards and partitioning them optimally.
