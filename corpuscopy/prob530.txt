B. Choosing Cubes
Dmitry has n𝑛 cubes, numbered from left to right from 11 to n𝑛. The cube with index f𝑓 is his favorite.
Dmitry threw all the cubes on the table, and the i𝑖-th cube showed the value ai𝑎𝑖 (1≤ai≤1001≤𝑎𝑖≤100). After that, he arranged the cubes in non-increasing order of their values, from largest to smallest. If two cubes show the same value, they can go in any order.
After sorting, Dmitry removed the first k𝑘 cubes. Then he became interested in whether he removed his favorite cube (note that its position could have changed after sorting).
For example, if n=5𝑛=5, f=2𝑓=2, a=[4,3,3,2,3]𝑎=[4,3,3,2,3] (the favorite cube is highlighted in green), and k=2𝑘=2, the following could have happened:
  - After sorting a=[4,3,3,3,2]𝑎=[4,3,3,3,2], since the favorite cube ended up in the second position, it will be removed.
  - After sorting a=[4,3,3,3,2]𝑎=[4,3,3,3,2], since the favorite cube ended up in the third position, it will not be removed.
