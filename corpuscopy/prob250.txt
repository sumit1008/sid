C. C+K+S
You are given two strongly connected† directed graphs, each with exactly n vertices, but possibly different numbers of edges. Upon closer inspection, you noticed an important feature — the length of any cycle in these graphs is divisible by k.
Each of the 2n vertices belongs to exactly one of two types: incoming or outgoing. For each vertex, its type is known to you.
You need to determine whether it is possible to draw exactly n directed edges between the source graphs such that the following four conditions are met:
  - The ends of any added edge lie in different graphs.
  - From each outgoing vertex, exactly one added edge originates.
  - Into each incoming vertex, exactly one added edge enters.
  - In the resulting graph, the length of any cycle is divisible by k.
†A strongly connected graph is a graph in which there is a path from every vertex to every other vertex.
