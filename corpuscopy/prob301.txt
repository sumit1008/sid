H. Strange Matrix
You are given a matrix a of size n×m, consisting of integers from 0 to 31 inclusive.
Let's call the matrix strange if for every two distinct rows i and j, both of the following conditions hold:
  - for every set of k indices (x1,x2,…,xk), where 1≤x1<x2<⋯<xk≤m, the equality ai,x1&aj,x1&ai,x2&aj,x2&⋯&ai,xk&aj,xk=0 holds (where & — bitwise AND of two numbers);
  - for every set of k indices (x1,x2,…,xk), where 1≤x1<x2<⋯<xk≤m, the equality ai,x1|aj,x1|ai,x2|aj,x2|⋯|ai,xk|aj,xk=31 holds (where | — bitwise OR of two numbers).
You can perform the following operation any number of times: take any row of the matrix and a number y from 0 to 31 inclusive; then apply the bitwise XOR with the number y to all elements of the selected row. The cost of such an operation is equal to y.
Your task is to calculate the minimum cost to make the matrix strange, or report that it is impossible.
