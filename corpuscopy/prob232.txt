F. Bermart Ice Cream
In the Bermart chain of stores, a variety of ice cream is sold. Each type of ice cream has two parameters: price and tastiness.
Initially, there is one store numbered 1, which sells nothing. You have to process q queries of the following types:
  - 1 x — a new store opens, that sells the same types of ice cream as store x. It receives the minimum available positive index. The order of the types of ice cream in the new store is the same as in store x.
  - 2 x p t — a type of ice cream with price p and tastiness t becomes available in store x.
  - 3 x — a type of ice cream that was available the longest (appeared the earliest) in store x is removed.
  - 4 x p — for store x, find the maximum total tastiness of a subset of types of ice cream that are sold there, such that the total price does not exceed p (each type can be used in the subset no more than once).
