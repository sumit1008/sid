D. Slavic's Exam
Slavic has a very tough exam and needs your help in order to pass it. Here is the question he is struggling with:
There exists a string s, which consists of lowercase English letters and possibly zero or more "?".
Slavic is asked to change each "?" to a lowercase English letter such that string t becomes a subsequence (not necessarily continuous) of the string s.
Output any such string, or say that it is impossible in case no string that respects the conditions exists.
