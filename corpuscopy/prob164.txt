B. Startup
Arseniy came up with another business plan â€” to sell soda from a vending machine! For this, he purchased a machine with n shelves, as well as k bottles, where the i-th bottle is characterized by the brand index bi and the cost ci.
You can place any number of bottles on each shelf, but all bottles on the same shelf must be of the same brand.
Arseniy knows that all the bottles he puts on the shelves of the machine will be sold. Therefore, he asked you to calculate the maximum amount he can earn.
