B. Progressive Square
A progressive square of size n is an n√ón matrix. Maxim chooses three integers a1,1, c, and d and constructs a progressive square according to the following rules:
ai+1,j=ai,j+c
ai,j+1=ai,j+d
For example, if n=3, a1,1=1, c=2, and d=3, then the progressive square looks as follows:
(1473695811)
Last month Maxim constructed a progressive square and remembered the values of n, c, and d. Recently, he found an array b of n2 integers in random order and wants to make sure that these elements are the elements of that specific square.
It can be shown that for any values of n, a1,1, c, and d, there exists exactly one progressive square that satisfies all the rules.
