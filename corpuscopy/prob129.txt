A. Game of Division
You are given an array of integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ of length $$$n$$$ and an integer $$$k$$$.
Two players are playing a game. The first player chooses an index $$$1 \le i \le n$$$. Then the second player chooses a different index $$$1 \le j \le n, i \neq j$$$. The first player wins if $$$|a_i - a_j|$$$ is not divisible by $$$k$$$. Otherwise, the second player wins.
We play as the first player. Determine whether it is possible to win, and if so, which index $$$i$$$ should be chosen.
The absolute value of a number $$$x$$$ is denoted by $$$|x|$$$ and is equal to $$$x$$$ if $$$x \ge 0$$$, and $$$-x$$$ otherwise.
