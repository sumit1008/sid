B. Battle Cows
There are n cows participating in a coding tournament. Cow i has a Cowdeforces rating of ai (all distinct), and is initially in position i. The tournament consists of n−1 matches as follows:
  - The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2.
  - Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i−1.
  - In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match.
You are the owner of cow k. For you, winning the tournament is not important; rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do nothing.
Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.
