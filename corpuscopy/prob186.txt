D. Kousuke's Assignment
After a trip with Sakurako, Kousuke was very scared because he forgot about his programming assignment. In this assignment, the teacher gave him an array a of n integers and asked him to calculate the number of non-overlapping segments of the array a, such that each segment is considered beautiful.
A segment [l,r] is considered beautiful if al+al+1+⋯+ar−1+ar=0.
For a fixed array a, your task is to compute the maximum number of non-overlapping beautiful segments.
