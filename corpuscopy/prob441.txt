I. Grid Game
This is an interactive problem.
You are given a grid with n rows and m columns. You need to fill each cell with a unique integer from 1 to nâ‹…m.
After filling the grid, you will play a game on this grid against the interactor. Players take turns selecting one of the previously unselected cells from the grid, with the interactor going first.
On the first turn, the interactor can choose any cell from the grid. After that, any chosen cell must be orthogonally adjacent to at least one previously selected cell. Two cells are considered orthogonally adjacent if they share an edge. The game continues until all cells have been selected.
Your goal is to let the sum of numbers in the cells selected by you be strictly less than the sum of numbers in the cells selected by the interactor.
