C. Tree Compass
You are given a tree with 𝑛n vertices numbered 1,2,…,𝑛1,2,…,n. Initially, all vertices are colored white.
You can perform the following two-step operation:
Construct a sequence of operations to color all the nodes in the tree black using the minimum possible number of operations. It can be proven that it is always possible to do so using at most 𝑛n operations.
†† dist(𝑥,𝑦)dist(x,y) denotes the number of edges on the (unique) simple path between vertices 𝑥x and 𝑦y on the tree.
