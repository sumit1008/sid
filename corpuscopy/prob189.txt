A. Sakurako and Kosuke
Sakurako and Kosuke decided to play some games with a dot on a coordinate line. The dot is currently located in position x=0. They will be taking turns, and Sakurako will be the one to start.
On the i-th move, the current player will move the dot in some direction by 2⋅i−1 units. Sakurako will always be moving the dot in the negative direction, whereas Kosuke will always move it in the positive direction.
In other words, the following will happen:
They will keep on playing while the absolute value of the coordinate of the dot does not exceed n. More formally, the game continues while −n≤x≤n. It can be proven that the game will always end.
Your task is to determine who will be the one who makes the last turn.
