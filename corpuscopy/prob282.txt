C. Tree Pruning
You are given a tree with 𝑛n nodes, rooted at node 11. In this problem, a leaf is a non-root node with degree 11.
In one operation, you can remove a leaf and the edge adjacent to it (possibly, new leaves appear). What is the minimum number of operations that you have to perform to get a tree, also rooted at node 11, where all the leaves are at the same distance from the root?
