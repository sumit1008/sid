F. Expected Median
Arul has a binary array∗∗ 𝑎a of length 𝑛n.
He will take all subsequences†† of length 𝑘k (𝑘k is odd) of this array and find their median.‡‡
What is the sum of all these values?
As this sum can be very large, output it modulo 109+7109+7. In other words, print the remainder of this sum when divided by 109+7109+7.
