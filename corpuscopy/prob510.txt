B. Corner Twist
You are given two grids of numbers a and b, with n rows and m columns. All the values in the grid are 0, 1 or 2.
You can perform the following operation on a any number of times:
  - Pick any subrectangle in the grid with length and width â‰¥2. You are allowed to choose the entire grid as a subrectangle.
  - The subrectangle has four corners. Take any pair of diagonally opposite corners of the chosen subrectangle and add 1 to their values modulo 3.
  - For the pair of corners not picked, add 2 to their values modulo 3.
Note that the operation only changes the values of the corners of the picked subrectangle.
Is it possible to convert the grid a into grid b by applying the above operation any number of times (possibly zero)?
