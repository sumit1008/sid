C. Palindromic Subsequences

For an integer sequence a=[a1,a2,…,an], we define f(a) as the length of the longest subsequence∗ of a that is a palindrome†.
Let g(a) represent the number of subsequences of length f(a) that are palindromes. In other words, g(a) counts the number of palindromic subsequences in a that have the maximum length.
Given an integer n, your task is to find any sequence a of n integers that satisfies the following conditions:
  - 1≤ai≤n for all 1≤i≤n.
  - g(a)>n
It can be proven that such a sequence always exists under the given constraints.
