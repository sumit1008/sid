B. Square or Not
A beautiful binary matrix is a matrix that has ones on its edges and zeros inside.
Today, Sakurako was playing with a beautiful binary matrix of size r×c and created a binary string s by writing down all the rows of the matrix, starting from the first and ending with the r-th. More formally, the element from the matrix in the i-th row and j-th column corresponds to the ((i−1)∗c+j)-th element of the string.
You need to check whether the beautiful matrix from which the string s was obtained could be squared. In other words, you need to check whether the string s could have been build from a square beautiful binary matrix (i.e., one where r=c).
