F. Bomb
Sparkle gives you two arrays a and b of length n. Initially, your score is 0. In one operation, you can choose an integer i and add ai to your score. Then, you must set ai = max(0,aiâˆ’bi).
You only have time to perform k operations before Sparkle sets off a nuclear bomb! What is the maximum score you can acquire after k operations?
