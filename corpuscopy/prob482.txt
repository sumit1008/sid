E. Beautiful Array
You are given an array of integers a1,a2,…,an and an integer k. You need to make it beautiful with the least amount of operations.
Before applying operations, you can shuffle the array elements as you like. For one operation, you can do the following:
  - Choose an index 1≤i≤n,
  - Make ai=ai+k.
The array b1,b2,…,bn is beautiful if bi=bn−i+1 for all 1≤i≤n.
Find the minimum number of operations needed to make the array beautiful, or report that it is impossible.
