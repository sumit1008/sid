C. Nikita and LCM
Nikita is a student passionate about number theory and algorithms. He faces an interesting problem related to an array of numbers.
Suppose Nikita has an array of integers a of length n. He will call a subsequence† of the array special if its least common multiple (LCM) is not contained in a. The LCM of an empty subsequence is equal to 0.
Nikita wonders: what is the length of the longest special subsequence of a? Help him answer this question!
† A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, [5,2,3] is a subsequence of [1,5,7,8,2,4,3].
