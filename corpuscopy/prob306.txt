C. Split the Expression
You are given a string s of the form <block of digits>+<block of digits>+...+<block of digits>. Every block of digits consists of at least 2 and at most 13 digits; every digit is from 1 to 9.
You have to split this string into expressions of the form <integer>+<integer>. Every expression must be a contiguous part of the given string, and every character of the given string must belong to exactly one expression. For example, if you have a string 123+456+789+555, then:
  - you are allowed to split it into 123+4, 56+7 and 89+555;
  - you are not allowed to split it into 123+456 and +789+555, since the second part begins with a + sign;
  - you are not allowed to split it into 123+4, 56+7, 8 and 9+555, since the third part does not contain a + sign;
  - you are not allowed to split it into 123+456+78 and 9+555, since the first part contains two + signs.
Among all allowed ways to split the string, find one which maximizes the sum of results of all expressions you get, and print this sum.
