B. Angry Monk
To celebrate his recovery, k1o0n has baked an enormous n metres long potato casserole.
Turns out, Noobish_Monk just can't stand potatoes, so he decided to ruin k1o0n's meal. He has cut it into k pieces, of lengths a1,a2,…,ak meters.
k1o0n wasn't keen on that. Luckily, everything can be fixed. In order to do that, k1o0n can do one of the following operations:
  - Pick a piece with length ai≥2 and divide it into two pieces with lengths 1 and ai−1. As a result, the number of pieces will increase by 1;
  - Pick a slice ai and another slice with length aj=1 (i≠j) and merge them into one piece with length ai+1. As a result, the number of pieces will decrease by 1.
Help k1o0n to find the minimum number of operations he needs to do in order to merge the casserole into one piece with length n.
For example, if n=5, k=2 and a=[3,2], it is optimal to do the following:
