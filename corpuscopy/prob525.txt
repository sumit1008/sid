F2. Field Division (hard version)
This is a hard version of the problem; it differs from the easy version only by the question. The easy version only needs you to print whether some values are non-zero or not. The hard version needs you to print the exact values.
Alice and Bob are dividing the field. The field is a rectangle of size 𝑛×𝑚n×m (2≤𝑛,𝑚≤1092≤n,m≤109); the rows are numbered from 11 to 𝑛n from top to bottom, and the columns are numbered from 11 to 𝑚m from left to right. The cell at the intersection of row 𝑟r and column 𝑐c is denoted as (𝑟,𝑐r,c).
Bob has 𝑘k (2≤𝑘≤2⋅1052≤k≤2⋅105) fountains, all of them are located in different cells of the field. Alice is responsible for dividing the field, but she must meet several conditions:
  - To divide the field, Alice will start her path in any free (without a fountain) cell on the left or top side of the field and will move, each time moving to the adjacent cell down or right. Her path will end on the right or bottom side of the field.
  - Alice's path will divide the field into two parts — one part will belong to Alice (this part includes the cells of her path), the other part — to Bob.
  - Alice will own the part that includes the cell (𝑛,1n,1).
  - Bob will own the part that includes the cell (1,𝑚1,m).
Alice wants to divide the field in such a way as to get as many cells as possible.
Bob wants to keep ownership of all the fountains, but he can give one of them to Alice. First, output the integer 𝛼α — the maximum possible size of Alice's plot, if Bob does not give her any fountain (i.e., all fountains will remain on Bob's plot).
Then output 𝑘k non-negative integers 𝑎1,𝑎2,…,𝑎𝑘a1,a2,…,ak, where 𝑎𝑖ai is a value such that after Bob gives Alice the 𝑖i-th fountain, the maximum size of her plot will be 𝛼+𝑎𝑖α+ai.
