B. Crafting

There are n different types of magical materials, numbered from 1 to n. Initially, you have ai units of material i for each i from 1 to n. You are allowed to perform the following operation:
  - Select a material i (where 1≤i≤n). Then, spend 1 unit of every other material j (in other words, j≠i) to gain 1 unit of material i. More formally, after selecting material i, update array a as follows: ai:=ai+1, and aj:=aj−1 for all j where j≠i and 1≤j≤n. Note that all aj must remain non-negative, i.e. you cannot spend resources you do not have.
You are trying to craft an artifact using these materials. To successfully craft the artifact, you must have at least bi units of material i for each i from 1 to n. Determine if it is possible to craft the artifact by performing the operation any number of times (including zero).
