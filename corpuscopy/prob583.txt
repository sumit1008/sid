D. Binary Cut
You are given a binary string††. Please find the minimum number of pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged into a sorted binary string.
Note that:
  - each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces;
  - the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string;
  - you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement.
†† A binary string is a string consisting of characters 0 and 1. A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all characters 0 come before all characters 1.
