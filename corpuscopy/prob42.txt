C. Preparing for the Exam
Monocarp is preparing for his first exam at the university. There are n different questions which can be asked during the exam, numbered from 1 to n. There are m different lists of questions; each list consists of exactly n−1 different questions. Each list i is characterized by one integer ai, which is the index of the only question which is not present in the i-th list. For example, if n=4 and ai=3, the i-th list contains questions [1,2,4].
During the exam, Monocarp will receive one of these m lists of questions. Then, the professor will make Monocarp answer all questions from the list. So, Monocarp will pass only if he knows all questions from the list.
Monocarp knows the answers for k questions q1,q2,…,qk. For each list, determine if Monocarp will pass the exam if he receives that list.
