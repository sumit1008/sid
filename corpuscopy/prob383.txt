B. Seating in a Bus
In Berland, a bus consists of a row of n seats numbered from 1 to n. Passengers are advised to always board the bus following these rules:
  - If there are no occupied seats in the bus, a passenger can sit in any free seat;
  - Otherwise, a passenger should sit in any free seat that has at least one occupied neighboring seat. In other words, a passenger can sit in a seat with index i (1≤i≤n) only if at least one of the seats with indices i−1 or i+1 is occupied.
Today, n passengers boarded the bus. The array a chronologically records the seat numbers they occupied. That is, a1 contains the seat number where the first passenger sat, a2 — the seat number where the second passenger sat, and so on.
You know the contents of the array a. Determine whether all passengers followed the recommendations.
For example, if n=5, and a = [5,4,2,1,3], then the recommendations were not followed, as the 3-rd passenger sat in seat number 2, while the neighboring seats with numbers 1 and 3 were free.
