A. Turtle and Piggy Are Playing a Game
Turtle and Piggy are playing a number game.
First, Turtle will choose an integer x, such that l≤x≤r, where l,r are given. It's also guaranteed that 2l≤r.
Then, Piggy will keep doing the following operation until x becomes 1:
  - Choose an integer p such that p≥2 and p∣x (i.e. x is a multiple of p).
  - Set x to xp, and the score will increase by 1.
The score is initially 0. Both Turtle and Piggy want to maximize the score. Please help them to calculate the maximum score.
