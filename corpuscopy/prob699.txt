D. Product of Binary Decimals
Let's call a number a binary decimal if it is a positive integer and all digits in its decimal notation are either 0 or 1. For example, 1010111 is a binary decimal, while 10201 and 787788 are not.
Given a number n, you are asked whether or not it is possible to represent n as a product of some (not necessarily distinct) binary decimals.
