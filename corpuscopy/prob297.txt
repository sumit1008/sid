C. Password Cracking
Dimash learned that Mansur wrote something very unpleasant about him to a friend, so he decided to find out his password at all costs and discover what exactly he wrote.
Believing in the strength of his password, Mansur stated that his password — is a binary string of length n. He is also ready to answer Dimash's questions of the following type:
Dimash says a binary string t, and Mansur replies whether it is true that t is a substring of his password.
Help Dimash find out the password in no more than 2n operations; otherwise, Mansur will understand the trick and stop communicating with him.
