This is an interactive problem.
You are given two positive integers n and m (n≤m).
The jury has hidden from you a rectangular matrix a with n rows and m columns, where ai,j∈{−1,0,1} for all 1≤i≤n and 1≤j≤m. The jury has also selected a cell (i0,j0). Your goal is to find (i0,j0).
In one query, you give a cell (i,j), then the jury will reply with an integer.
  - If (i,j)=(i0,j0), the jury will reply with 0.
  - Else, let S be the sum of ax,y over all x and y such that min and \min(j, j_0) \le y \le \max(j, j_0). Then, the jury will reply with |i - i_0| + |j - j_0| + |S|.
Find (i_0, j_0) by making at most n + 225 queries.
Note: the grader is not adaptive: a and (i_0,j_0) are fixed before any queries are made.
