A. Rudolf and the Ticket
Rudolf is going to visit Bernard, and he decided to take the metro to get to him. The ticket can be purchased at a machine that accepts exactly two coins, the sum of which does not exceed k.
Rudolf has two pockets with coins. In the left pocket, there are n coins with denominations b1,b2,…,bn. In the right pocket, there are m coins with denominations c1,c2,…,cm. He wants to choose exactly one coin from the left pocket and exactly one coin from the right pocket (two coins in total).
Help Rudolf determine how many ways there are to select indices f and s such that bf+cs≤k.
