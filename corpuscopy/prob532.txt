F. Kostyanych's Theorem
This is an interactive problem.
Kostyanych has chosen a complete undirected graph†† with n vertices, and then removed exactly (n−2) edges from it. You can ask queries of the following type:
  - "? d" — Kostyanych tells you the number of vertex v with a degree at least d. Among all possible such vertices, he selects the vertex with the minimum degree, and if there are several such vertices, he selects the one with the minimum number. He also tells you the number of another vertex in the graph, with which v is not connected by an edge (if none is found, then 0 is reported). Among all possible such vertices, he selects the one with the minimum number. Then he removes the vertex v and all edges coming out of it. If the required vertex v is not found, then "0 0" is reported.
Find a Hamiltonian path‡ in the original graph in at most n queries. It can be proven that under these constraints, a Hamiltonian path always exists.
†A complete undirected graph is a graph in which there is exactly one undirected edge between any pair of distinct vertices. Thus, a complete undirected graph with n vertices contains n(n−1)2 edges.
‡A Hamiltonian path in a graph is a path that passes through each vertex exactly once.
