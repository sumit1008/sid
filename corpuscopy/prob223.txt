B. Alice's Adventures in Permuting
Alice mixed up the words transmutation and permutation! She has an array a specified via three integers n, b, c: the array a has length n and is given via ai=b⋅(i−1)+c for 1≤i≤n. For example, if n=3, b=2, and c=1, then a=[2⋅0+1,2⋅1+1,2⋅2+1]=[1,3,5].
Now, Alice really enjoys permutations of [0,…,n−1]∗ and would like to transform a into a permutation. In one operation, Alice replaces the maximum element of a with the MEX† of a. If there are multiple maximum elements in a, Alice chooses the leftmost one to replace.
Can you help Alice figure out how many operations she has to do for a to become a permutation for the first time? If it is impossible, you should report it.
