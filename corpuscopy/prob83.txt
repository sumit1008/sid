H. Missing Separators
You have a dictionary, which is a list of distinct words sorted in alphabetical order. Each word consists of uppercase English letters.
You want to print this dictionary. However, there is a bug with the printing system, and all words in the list are printed next to each other without any separators between words. Now, you ended up with a string $$$S$$$ that is a concatenation of all the words in the dictionary in the listed order.
Your task is to reconstruct the dictionary by splitting $$$S$$$ into one or more words. Note that the reconstructed dictionary must consist of distinct words sorted in alphabetical order. Furthermore, you want to maximize the number of words in the dictionary. If there are several possible dictionaries with the maximum number of words, you can choose any of them.
