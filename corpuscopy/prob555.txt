Jellyfish is playing a one-player card game called "Slay the Spire". There are n cards in total numbered from 1 to n. The i-th card has power ci.
There is a binary string s of length n. If si=0, the i-th card is initially in the draw pile. If si=1, the i-th card is initially in Jellyfish's hand.
Jellyfish will repeat the following process until either her hand or the draw pile is empty.
At the end of this process, find the probability that Jellyfish can empty the draw pile, modulo 1000000007.
Formally, let M=1000000007. It can be shown that the answer can be expressed as an irreducible fraction pq, where p and q are integers and qâ‰¢. Output the integer equal to p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod M. In other words, output such an integer x that 0 \le x < M and x \cdot q \equiv p \pmod{M}.
