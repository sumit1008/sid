C. Annual Ants' Gathering
Deep within a forest lies an ancient tree, home to 𝑛n ants living in 𝑛n tiny houses, indexed from 11 to 𝑛n, connected by the branches of the tree.
Once a year, all the ants need to gather to watch the EUC. For this, all ants move along the 𝑛−1n−1 branches of the tree they live on to meet at the home of one ant.
However, this year the ants could not agree on where to meet and need your help to gather up. You can tell all the ants currently at house 𝑢u to move to house 𝑣v if there is a branch directly connecting those two houses. However, the ants ignore your command if there are fewer ants gathered in house 𝑣v than in house 𝑢u, i.e., if it would be easier for the ants from house 𝑣v to move. This even holds true if no ant at all is currently in house 𝑣v. You can give this kind of commands as many times as you want.
Is it possible for you to gather all the ants in a single house?
