G2. Yunli's Subarray Queries (hard version)
This is the hard version of the problem. In this version, it is guaranteed that r≥l+k−1 for all queries.
For an arbitrary array b, Yunli can perform the following operation any number of times:
  - Select an index i. Set bi=x where x is any integer she desires (x is not limited to the interval [1,n]).
Denote f(b) as the minimum number of operations she needs to perform until there exists a consecutive subarray∗ of length at least k in b.
Yunli is given an array a of size n and asks you q queries. In each query, you must output ∑rj=l+k−1f([al,al+1,…,aj]).
