A. Profitable Interest Rate
Alice has 𝑎a coins. She can open a bank deposit called "Profitable", but the minimum amount required to open this deposit is 𝑏b coins.
There is also a deposit called "Unprofitable", which can be opened with any amount of coins. Alice noticed that if she opens the "Unprofitable" deposit with 𝑥x coins, the minimum amount required to open the "Profitable" deposit decreases by 2𝑥2x coins. However, these coins cannot later be deposited into the "Profitable" deposit.
Help Alice determine the maximum number of coins she can deposit into the "Profitable" deposit if she first deposits some amount of coins (possibly 00) into the "Unprofitable" deposit. If Alice can never open the "Profitable" deposit, output 00.
