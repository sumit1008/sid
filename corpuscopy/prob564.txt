G. Money Buys Less Happiness Now
You can never buy enough happiness, so here we go again! In this version, you can only buy hi=1 unit of happiness each month, but the number of months is hugely increased. We are in the realm of quantum happiness and time dilation.
Being a physicist, Charlie likes to plan his life in simple and precise terms.
For the next m months, starting with no money, Charlie will work hard and earn x pounds per month. For the i-th month (1≤i≤m), there'll be a single opportunity of paying cost ci pounds to obtain one unit of happiness. You cannot buy more than one unit each month.
Borrowing is not allowed. Money earned in the i-th month can only be spent in a later j-th month (j>i).
Since physicists don't code, help Charlie find the maximum reachable units of happiness.
