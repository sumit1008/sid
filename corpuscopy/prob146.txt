G. Guess One Character
This is an interactive problem. You have to use flush operation right after printing each line. For example, in C++ you should use the function fflush(stdout) or cout.flush(), in Java or Kotlin — System.out.flush(), and in Python — sys.stdout.flush().
The jury has a string s consisting of characters 0 and/or 1. The length of this string is n.
You can ask the following queries:
  - 1 t — "how many times does t appear in s as a contiguous substring?" Here, t should be a string consisting of characters 0 and/or 1; its length should be at least 1 and at most n. For example, if the string s is 111011 and the string t is 11, the response to the query is 3.
You have to guess at least one character in the string s by asking no more than 3 queries. Note that giving the answer does not count as a query.
In every test and in every test case, the string s is fixed beforehand.
