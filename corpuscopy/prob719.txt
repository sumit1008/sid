B. Array Fix
You are given an integer array a of length n.
You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero): take any element of the array a, which is at least 10, delete it, and instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in order they appear in that element.
For example:
  - if we apply this operation to the 3-rd element of the array [12,3,45,67], then the array becomes [12,3,4,5,67].
  - if we apply this operation to the 2-nd element of the array [2,10], then the array becomes [2,1,0].
Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times (possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to transform the array a in such a way that a1≤a2≤⋯≤ak, where k is the current length of the array a.
