F. Turtle and Paths on a Tree
Note the unusual definition of MEXMEX in this problem.
Piggy gave Turtle a binary tree† with n vertices and a sequence a1,a2,…,an on his birthday. The binary tree is rooted at vertex 1.
If a set of paths P={(xi,yi)} in the tree covers each edge exactly once, then Turtle will think that the set of paths is good. Note that a good set of paths can cover a vertex twice or more.
Turtle defines the value of a set of paths as ∑(x,y)∈Pf(x,y), where f(x,y) denotes the MEX‡ of all au such that vertex u is on the simple path from x to y in the tree (including the starting vertex x and the ending vertex y).
Turtle wonders the minimum value over all good sets of paths. Please help him calculate the answer!
†A binary tree is a tree where every non-leaf vertex has at most 2 sons.
‡MEX of a collection of integers c1,c2,…,ck is defined as the smallest positive integer x which does not occur in the collection c. For example, MEX of [3,3,1,4] is 2, MEX of [2,3] is 1.
