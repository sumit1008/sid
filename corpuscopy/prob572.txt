E. Cat, Fox and Swaps
Fox has found an array 𝑝1,𝑝2,…,𝑝𝑛, that is a permutation of length 𝑛† of the numbers 1,2,…,𝑛. She wants to sort the elements in increasing order. Cat wants to help her — he is able to swap any two numbers 𝑥 and 𝑦 in the array, but only if 𝑙≤𝑥+𝑦≤𝑟 (note that the constraint is imposed on the values of the elements, not their positions). He can make such swaps any number of times.
They don't know the numbers 𝑙, 𝑟 yet, they only know that it's true that 1≤𝑙≤𝑟≤2⋅𝑛.
You are given the number 𝑛 and the array 𝑝1,𝑝2,…,𝑝𝑛. Determine how many pairs (𝑙,𝑟) satisfying the conditions are there such that you can sort the permutation if you can only swap two number (𝑥,𝑦) such that 𝑙≤𝑥+𝑦≤𝑟 (arbitrary number of times, possibly 0).
† A permutation of length 𝑛 is an array consisting of 𝑛 distinct integers from 1 to 𝑛 in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (𝑛=3 but there is 4 in the array).
