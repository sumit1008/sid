G1. Permutation Problem (Simple Version)
This is a simple version of the problem. The only difference is that in this version n≤105 and the sum of n for all sets of input data does not exceed 105.
You are given a permutation p of length n. Calculate the number of index pairs 1≤i<j≤n such that pi⋅pj is divisible by i⋅j without remainder.
A permutation is a sequence of n integers, where each integer from 1 to n occurs exactly once. For example, [1], [3,5,2,1,4], [1,3,2] are permutations, while [2,3,2], [4,3,1], [0] are not.
