E. Permutations Harmony
Rayan wants to present a gift to Reyhaneh to win her heart. However, Reyhaneh is particular and will only accept a k-harmonic set of permutations.
We define a k-harmonic set of permutations as a set of k pairwise distinct permutations p1,p2,…,pk of size n such that for every pair of indices i and j (where 1≤i,j≤n), the following condition holds:
p1[i]+p2[i]+…+pk[i]=p1[j]+p2[j]+…+pk[j]
Your task is to help Rayan by either providing a valid k-harmonic set of permutations for given values of n and k or by determining that such a set does not exist.
We call a sequence of length n a permutation if it contains every integer from 1 to n exactly once.
