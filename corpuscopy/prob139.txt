N. Fixing the Expression
An expression is a string consisting of three characters, where the first and the last characters are digits (from 0 to 9), and the middle character is a comparison symbol (<, = or >).
An expression is true if the comparison symbol matches the digits (for example, if the first digit is strictly less than the last digit, the comparison symbol should be <).
For example, the expressions 1<3, 4>2, 0=0 are true, while 5>5, 7<3 are not.
You are given a string s, which is an expression. Change as few characters as possible so that s becomes a true expression. Note that if s is already true, you should leave it as it is.
