B. Penchick and Satay Sticks
Penchick and his friend Kohane are touring Indonesia, and their next stop is in Surabaya!
In the bustling food stalls of Surabaya, Kohane bought n𝑛 satay sticks and arranged them in a line, with the i𝑖-th satay stick having length pi𝑝𝑖. It is given that p𝑝 is a permutation∗∗ of length n𝑛.
Penchick wants to sort the satay sticks in increasing order of length, so that pi=i𝑝𝑖=𝑖 for each 1≤i≤n1≤𝑖≤𝑛. For fun, they created a rule: they can only swap neighboring satay sticks whose lengths differ by exactly 11. Formally, they can perform the following operation any number of times (including zero):
  - Select an index i𝑖 (1≤i≤n−11≤𝑖≤𝑛−1) such that |pi+1−pi|=1;
  - Swap pi and pi+1.
Determine whether it is possible to sort the permutation p, thus the satay sticks, by performing the above operation.
