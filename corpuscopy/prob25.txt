G. Naive String Splits
Cocoly has a string t of length m, consisting of lowercase English letters, and he would like to split it into parts. He calls a pair of strings (x,y) beautiful if and only if there exists a sequence of strings a1,a2,…,ak, such that:
  - t=a1+a2+…+ak, where + denotes string concatenation.
  - For each 1≤i≤k, at least one of the following holds: ai=x, or ai=y.
Cocoly has another string s of length n, consisting of lowercase English letters. Now, for each 1≤i<n, Cocoly wants you to determine whether the pair of strings (s1s2…si,si+1si+2…sn) is beautiful.
Note: since the input and output are large, you may need to optimize them for this problem.
For example, in C++, it is enough to use the following lines at the start of the main() function:
