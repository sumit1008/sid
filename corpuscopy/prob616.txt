F. Equal XOR Segments
Let us call an array x1,…,xm interesting if it is possible to divide the array into k>1 parts so that bitwise XOR of values from each part are equal.
More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y1,…,yk be the XOR of elements from each part respectively. Then y1=y2=⋯=yk must be fulfilled.
For example, if x=[1,1,2,3,0], you can split it as follows: [1],[1],[2,3,0]. Indeed 1=1=2⊕3⊕0.
You are given an array a1,…,an. Your task is to answer q queries:
  - For fixed l, r, determine whether the subarray al,al+1,…,ar is interesting.
