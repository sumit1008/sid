D. DAG Serialization
Consider a simple single-bit boolean register that supports two operations:
  - set — sets the register to true if it was false, and returns true; otherwise, it returns false;
  - unset — sets the register to false if it was true, and returns true; otherwise, it returns false.
The initial state of the register is false. Suppose there were n operations opi (for 1≤i≤n) where at most two operations returned true. Also, we are given the partial order of operations as a directed acyclic graph (DAG): an edge i→j means that opi happened before opj. You are asked whether it is possible to put these operations in some linear sequential order that satisfies the given partial order and such that if operations are applied to the register in that order, their results are the same as given.
