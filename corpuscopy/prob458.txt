E. Distance to Different
Consider an array 𝑎a of 𝑛n integers, where every element is from 11 to 𝑘k, and every integer from 11 to 𝑘k appears at least once.
Let the array 𝑏b be constructed as follows: for the 𝑖i-th element of 𝑎a, 𝑏𝑖bi is the distance to the closest element in 𝑎a which is not equal to 𝑎𝑖ai. In other words, 𝑏𝑖=min𝑗∈[1,𝑛],𝑎𝑗≠𝑎𝑖|𝑖−𝑗|bi=minj∈[1,n],aj≠ai|i−j|.
For example, if 𝑎=[1,1,2,3,3,3,3,1]a=[1,1,2,3,3,3,3,1], then 𝑏=[2,1,1,1,2,2,1,1]b=[2,1,1,1,2,2,1,1].
Calculate the number of different arrays 𝑏b you can obtain if you consider all possible arrays 𝑎a, and print it modulo 998244353998244353.
