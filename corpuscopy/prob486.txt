A. X Axis
You are given three points with integer coordinates x1, x2, and x3 on the X axis (1≤xi≤10). You can choose any point with an integer coordinate a on the X axis. Note that the point a may coincide with x1, x2, or x3. Let f(a) be the total distance from the given points to the point a. Find the smallest value of f(a).
The distance between points a and b is equal to |a−b|. For example, the distance between points a=5 and b=2 is 3.
