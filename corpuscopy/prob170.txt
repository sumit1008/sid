D. Yet Another Real Number Problem
You are given an array b of length m. You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
  - Choose two distinct indices i and j where 1≤i<j≤m and bi is even, divide bi by 2 and multiply bj by 2.
Your task is to maximize the sum of the array after performing any number of such operations. Since it could be large, output this sum modulo
.
Since this problem is too easy, you are given an array a of length n and need to solve the problem for each prefix of a.
In other words, denoting the maximum sum of b after performing any number of such operations as f(b), you need to output f([a1]), f([a1,a2]), …, f([a1,a2,…,an]) modulo 109+7 respectively.
