You're given an array a initially containing n integers. In one operation, you must do the following:
  - Choose a position i such that 1<i≤|a| and ai=|a|+1−i, where |a| is the current size of the array.
  - Append i−1 zeros onto the end of a.
After performing this operation as many times as you want, what is the maximum possible length of the array a?
