E. Cosmic Rays
Given an array of integers s1,s2,…,sl, every second, cosmic rays will cause all si such that i=1 or si≠si−1 to be deleted simultaneously, and the remaining parts will be concatenated together in order to form the new array s1,s2,…,sl′.
Define the strength of an array as the number of seconds it takes to become empty.
You are given an array of integers compressed in the form of n pairs that describe the array left to right. Each pair (ai,bi) represents ai copies of bi, i.e. bi,bi,⋯,bi⏟ai times.
For each i=1,2,…,n, please find the strength of the sequence described by the first i pairs.
