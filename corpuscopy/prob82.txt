I. Microwavable Subsequence
You are given an array of N integers: [A1,A2,…,AN].
A subsequence can be derived from an array by removing zero or more elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, [2,1,2], [3,3], [1], and [3,2,1,3,2] are subsequences of array [3,2,1,3,2], while [1,2,3] is not a subsequence of array [3,2,1,3,2].
A subsequence is microwavable if the subsequence consists of at most two distinct values and each element differs from its adjacent elements. For example, [2,1,2], [3,2,3,2], and [1] are microwavable, while [3,3] and [3,2,1,3,2] are not microwavable.
Denote a function f(x,y) as the length of the longest microwavable subsequence of array A such that each element within the subsequence is either x or y. Find the sum of f(x,y) for all 1≤x<y≤M.
