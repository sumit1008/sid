D. I Love 1543
One morning, Polycarp woke up and realized that 1543 is the most favorite number in his life.
The first thing that Polycarp saw that day as soon as he opened his eyes was a large wall carpet of size n by m cells; n and m are even integers. Each cell contains one of the digits from 0 to 9.
Polycarp became curious about how many times the number 1543 would appear in all layersâˆ— of the carpet when traversed clockwise.
