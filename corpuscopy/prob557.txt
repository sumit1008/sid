G. Zimpha Fan Club
One day, Zimpha casually came up with a problem. As a member of "Zimpha fan club", you decided to solve that problem.
You are given two strings 𝑠s and 𝑡t of length 𝑛n and 𝑚m, respectively. Both strings only consist of lowercase English letters, - and *.
You need to replace all occurrences of * and -, observing the following rules:
  - For each -, you must replace it with any lowercase English letter.
  - For each *, you must replace it with a string of any (possibly, zero) length which only consists of lowercase English letters.
Note that you can replace two different instances of - with different characters. You can also replace each two different instances of * with different strings.
Suppose 𝑠s and 𝑡t have been transformed into 𝑠′s′ and 𝑡′t′. Now you're wondering if there's a replacement that makes 𝑠′=𝑡′s′=t′.
