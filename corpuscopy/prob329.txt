A. Sakurako's Exam
Today, Sakurako has a math exam. The teacher gave the array, consisting of 𝑎a ones and 𝑏b twos.
In an array, Sakurako must place either a '+' or a '-' in front of each element so that the sum of all elements in the array equals 00.
Sakurako is not sure if it is possible to solve this problem, so determine whether there is a way to assign signs such that the sum of all elements in the array equals 00.
