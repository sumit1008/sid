A. Median of an Array
You are given an array a of n integers.
The median of an array q1,q2,…,qk is the number p⌈k2⌉, where p is the array q sorted in non-decreasing order. For example, the median of the array [9,5,1,2,6] is 5, as in the sorted array [1,2,5,6,9], the number at index ⌈52⌉=3 is 5, and the median of the array [9,2,8,3] is 3, as in the sorted array [2,3,8,9], the number at index ⌈42⌉=2 is 3.
You are allowed to choose an integer i (1≤i≤n) and increase ai by 1 in one operation.
Your task is to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array.
Note that the array a may not necessarily contain distinct numbers.
