B. Fireworks
One of the days of the hike coincided with a holiday, so in the evening at the camp, it was decided to arrange a festive fireworks display. For this purpose, the organizers of the hike bought two installations for launching fireworks and a huge number of shells for launching.
Both installations are turned on simultaneously. The first installation launches fireworks every a𝑎 minutes (i.e., after a,2⋅a,3⋅a,…𝑎,2⋅𝑎,3⋅𝑎,… minutes after launch). The second installation launches fireworks every b𝑏 minutes (i.e., after b,2⋅b,3⋅b,…𝑏,2⋅𝑏,3⋅𝑏,… minutes after launch).
Each firework is visible in the sky for m+1𝑚+1 minutes after launch, i.e., if a firework was launched after x𝑥 minutes after the installations were turned on, it will be visible every minute from x𝑥 to x+m𝑥+𝑚, inclusive. If one firework was launched m𝑚 minutes after another, both fireworks will be visible for one minute.
What is the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time?
