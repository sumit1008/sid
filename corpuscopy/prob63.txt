E. Kevin and Bipartite Graph
The Arms Factory needs a poster design pattern and finds Kevin for help.
A poster design pattern is a bipartite graph with 2n vertices in the left part and m vertices in the right part, where there is an edge between each vertex in the left part and each vertex in the right part, resulting in a total of 2nm edges.
Kevin must color each edge with a positive integer in the range [1,n]. A poster design pattern is good if there are no monochromatic cyclesâˆ— in the bipartite graph.
Kevin needs your assistance in constructing a good bipartite graph or informing him if it is impossible.
