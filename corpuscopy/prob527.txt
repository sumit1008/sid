E. Permutation of Rows and Columns
You have been given a matrix 𝑎a of size 𝑛n by 𝑚m, containing a permutation of integers from 11 to 𝑛⋅𝑚n⋅m.
A permutation of 𝑛n integers is an array containing all numbers from 11 to 𝑛n exactly once. For example, the arrays [1][1], [2,1,3][2,1,3], [5,4,3,2,1][5,4,3,2,1] are permutations, while the arrays [1,1][1,1], [100][100], [1,2,4,5][1,2,4,5] are not.
A matrix contains a permutation if, when all its elements are written out, the resulting array is a permutation. Matrices [[1,2],[3,4]][[1,2],[3,4]], [[1]][[1]], [[1,5,3],[2,6,4]][[1,5,3],[2,6,4]] contain permutations, while matrices [[2]][[2]], [[1,1],[2,2]][[1,1],[2,2]], [[1,2],[100,200]][[1,2],[100,200]] do not.
You can perform one of the following two actions in one operation:
  - choose columns 𝑐c and 𝑑d (1≤𝑐,𝑑≤𝑚1≤c,d≤m, 𝑐≠𝑑c≠d) and swap these columns;
  - choose rows 𝑐c and 𝑑d (1≤𝑐,𝑑≤𝑛1≤c,d≤n, 𝑐≠𝑑c≠d) and swap these rows.
You can perform any number of operations.
You are given the original matrix 𝑎a and the matrix 𝑏b. Your task is to determine whether it is possible to transform matrix 𝑎a into matrix 𝑏b using the given operations.
