B. Shifts and Sorting
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string 𝑠s as a transformation from 𝑠1𝑠2…𝑠𝑛−1𝑠𝑛s1s2…sn−1sn into 𝑠𝑛𝑠1𝑠2…𝑠𝑛−1sns1s2…sn−1. In other words, you take one last character 𝑠𝑛sn and place it before the first character while moving all other characters to the right.
You are given a binary string 𝑠s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).
In one operation, you can choose any substring 𝑠𝑙𝑠𝑙+1…𝑠𝑟slsl+1…sr (1≤𝑙<𝑟≤|𝑠|1≤l<r≤|s|) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to 𝑟−𝑙+1r−l+1 (or the length of the chosen substring).
You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum total cost to make 𝑠s sorted in non-descending order?
