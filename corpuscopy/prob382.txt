C. Numeric String Template
Kristina has an array a, called a template, consisting of n integers. She also has m strings, each consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. The strings are numbered from 1 to m. She wants to check which strings match the template.
A string s is considered to match the template if all of the following conditions are simultaneously satisfied:
  - The length of the string s is equal to the number of elements in the array a.
  - The same numbers from a correspond to the same symbols from s. So, if ai=aj, then si=sj for (1≤i,j≤n).
  - The same symbols from s correspond to the same numbers from a. So, if si=sj, then ai=aj for (1≤i,j≤n).
In other words, there must be a one-to-one correspondence between the characters of the string and the elements of the array.
For example, if a = [3,5,2,1,3], then the string "abfda" matches the template, while the string "afbfa" does not, since the character "f" corresponds to both numbers 1 and 5.
