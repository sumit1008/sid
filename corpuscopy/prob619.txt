C. Assembly via Remainders
You are given an array x2,x3,…,xn. Your task is to find any array a1,…,an, where:
  - 1≤ai≤109 for all 1≤i≤n.
  - xi=aimodai−1 for all 2≤i≤n.
Here cmodd denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the integer d. For example 5mod2=1, 72mod3=0, 143mod14=3.
Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are allowed to find any.
