B. XOR Sequences
You are given two distinct non-negative integers x𝑥 and y𝑦. Consider two infinite sequences a1,a2,a3,…𝑎1,𝑎2,𝑎3,… and b1,b2,b3,…𝑏1,𝑏2,𝑏3,…, where
  - an=n⊕x𝑎𝑛=𝑛⊕𝑥;
  - bn=n⊕y𝑏𝑛=𝑛⊕𝑦.
Here, x⊕y𝑥⊕𝑦 denotes the bitwise XOR operation of integers x𝑥 and y𝑦.
For example, with x=6𝑥=6, the first 88 elements of sequence a𝑎 will look as follows: [7,4,5,2,3,0,1,14,…][7,4,5,2,3,0,1,14,…]. Note that the indices of elements start with 11.
Your task is to find the length of the longest common subsegment†† of sequences a𝑎 and b𝑏. In other words, find the maximum integer m𝑚 such that ai=bj,ai+1=bj+1,…,ai+m−1=bj+m−1𝑎𝑖=𝑏𝑗,𝑎𝑖+1=𝑏𝑗+1,…,𝑎𝑖+𝑚−1=𝑏𝑗+𝑚−1 for some i,j≥1𝑖,𝑗≥1.
††A subsegment of sequence p𝑝 is a sequence pl,pl+1,…,pr𝑝𝑙,𝑝𝑙+1,…,𝑝𝑟, where 1≤l≤r1≤𝑙≤𝑟.
