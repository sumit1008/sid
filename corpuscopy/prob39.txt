F. Joker
Consider a deck of n cards. The positions in the deck are numbered from 1 to n from top to bottom. A joker is located at position m.
q operations are applied sequentially to the deck. During the i-th operation, you need to take the card at position ai and move it either to the beginning or to the end of the deck. For example, if the deck is [2,1,3,5,4], and ai=2, then after the operation the deck will be either [1,2,3,5,4] (the card from the second position moved to the beginning) or [2,3,5,4,1] (the card from the second position moved to the end).
Your task is to calculate the number of distinct positions where the joker can be after each operation.
