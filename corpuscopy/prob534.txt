D. Fixing a Binary String
You are given a binary string s of length n, consisting of zeros and ones. You can perform the following operation exactly once:
For example, if you apply the operation to the string 110001100110 with p=3, after the second step, the string will become 011001100110, and after the third step, it will become 001100110011.
A string s is called k-proper if two conditions are met:
  - s1=s2=…=sk;
  - si+k≠si for any i (1≤i≤n−k).
For example, with k=3, the strings 000, 111000111, and 111000 are k-proper, while the strings 000000, 001100, and 1110000 are not.
You are given an integer k, which is a divisor of n. Find an integer p (1≤p≤n) such that after performing the operation, the string s becomes k-proper, or determine that it is impossible. Note that if the string is initially k-proper, you still need to apply exactly one operation to it.
