G2. Go Learn! (Hard Version)
The differences between the easy and hard versions are the constraints on n and the sum of n. In this version, n≤3⋅105 and the sum of n does not exceed 106. You can only make hacks if both versions are solved.
Well, well, well, let's see how Bessie is managing her finances. She seems to be in the trenches! Fortunately, she is applying for a job at Moogle to resolve this issue. Moogle interviews require intensive knowledge of obscure algorithms and complex data structures, but Bessie received a tip-off from an LGM on exactly what she has to go learn.
Bessie wrote the following code to binary search for a certain element k in a possibly unsorted array [a1,a2,…,an] with n elements.
Bessie submitted her code to Farmer John's problem with m (1≤m≤n) tests. The i-th test is of the form (xi,ki) (1≤x,k≤n). It is guaranteed all the xi are distinct and all the ki are distinct.
Test i is correct if the following hold:
It might not be possible for all m tests to be correct on the same array, so Farmer John will remove some of them so Bessie can AC. Let r be the minimum of tests removed so that there exists an array [a1,a2,…,an] with 1≤ai≤n so that all remaining tests are correct.
In addition to finding r, Farmer John wants you to count the number of arrays [a1,a2,…,an] with 1≤ai≤n such that there exists a way to remove exactly r tests so that all the remaining tests are correct. Since this number may be very large, please find it modulo 998244353.
