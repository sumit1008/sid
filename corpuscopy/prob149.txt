D. Divide OR Conquer
You are given an array [a1,a2,…an] consisting of integers between 0 and 109. You have to split this array into several segments (possibly one) in such a way that each element belongs to exactly one segment.
Let the first segment be the array [al1,al1+1,…,ar1], the second segment be [al2,al2+1,…,ar2], ..., the last segment be [alk,alk+1,…,ark]. Since every element should belong to exactly one array, l1=1, rk=n, and ri+1=li+1 for each i from 1 to k−1. The split should meet the following condition: f([al1,al1+1,…,ar1])≤f([al2,al2+1,…,ar2])≤⋯≤f([alk,alk+1,…,ark]), where f(a) is the bitwise OR of all elements of the array a.
Calculate the number of ways to split the array, and print it modulo 998244353. Two ways are considered different if the sequences [l1,r1,l2,r2,…,lk,rk] denoting the splits are different.
