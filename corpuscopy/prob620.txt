B. Prefiquence
You are given two binary strings a and b. A binary string is a string consisting of the characters '0' and '1'.
Your task is to determine the maximum possible number k such that a prefix of string a of length k is a subsequence of string b.
A sequence a is a subsequence of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.
