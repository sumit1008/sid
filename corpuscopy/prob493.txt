C. Good Prefixes
Alex thinks some array is good if there exists some element that can be represented as the sum of all other elements (the sum of all other elements is 00 if there are no other elements). For example, the array [1,6,3,2][1,6,3,2] is good since 1+3+2=61+3+2=6. Furthermore, the array [0][0] is also good. However, the arrays [1,2,3,4][1,2,3,4] and [1][1] are not good.
Alex has an array a1,a2,…,an. Help him count the number of good non-empty prefixes of the array a. In other words, count the number of integers i (1≤i≤n) such that the length i prefix (i.e. a1,a2,…,ai) is good.
