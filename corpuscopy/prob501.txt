C2. Magnitude (Hard Version)
The two versions of the problem are different. You may want to read both versions. You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.
You are given an array a𝑎 of length n𝑛. Start with c=0𝑐=0. Then, for each i𝑖 from 11 to n𝑛 (in increasing order) do exactly one of the following:
  - Option 11: set c𝑐 to c+ai𝑐+𝑎𝑖.
  - Option 22: set c𝑐 to |c+ai|, where |x| is the absolute value of x.
Let the maximum final value of c after the procedure described above be equal to k. Find the number of unique procedures that result in c=k. Two procedures are different if at any index i, one procedure chose option 1 and another chose option 2, even if the value of c is equal for both procedures after that turn.
Since the answer may be large, output it modulo 998244353.
