A. Bus to Pénjamo
There are n families travelling to Pénjamo to witness Mexico's largest-ever "walking a chicken on a leash" marathon. The i-th family has ai family members. All families will travel using a single bus consisting of r rows with 2 seats each.
A person is considered happy if:
  - Another family member is seated in the same row as them, or
  - They are sitting alone in their row (with an empty seat next to them).
Determine the maximum number of happy people in an optimal seating arrangement. Note that everyone must be seated in the bus.
It is guaranteed that all family members will fit on the bus. Formally, it is guaranteed that n∑i=1ai≤2r.
