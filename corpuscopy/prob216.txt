C. New Rating
Kevin used to be a participant of Codeforces. Recently, the KDOI Team has developed a new Online Judge called Forcescode.
Kevin has participated in n contests on Forcescode. In the i-th contest, his performance rating is ai.
Now he has hacked into the backend of Forcescode and will select an interval [l,r] (1≤l≤r≤n), then skip all of the contests in this interval. After that, his rating will be recalculated in the following way:
  - Initially, his rating is x=0;
  - For each 1≤i≤n, after the i-th contest,   If l≤i≤r, this contest will be skipped, and the rating will remain unchanged;  Otherwise, his rating will be updated according to the following rules:   If ai>x, his rating x will increase by 1;  If ai=x, his rating x will remain unchanged;  If ai<x, his rating x will decrease by 1.
  - If l≤i≤r, this contest will be skipped, and the rating will remain unchanged;
  - Otherwise, his rating will be updated according to the following rules:   If ai>x, his rating x will increase by 1;  If ai=x, his rating x will remain unchanged;  If ai<x, his rating x will decrease by 1.
  - If ai>x, his rating x will increase by 1;
  - If ai=x, his rating x will remain unchanged;
  - If ai<x, his rating x will decrease by 1.
You have to help Kevin to find his maximum possible rating after the recalculation if he chooses the interval [l,r] optimally. Note that Kevin has to skip at least one contest.
