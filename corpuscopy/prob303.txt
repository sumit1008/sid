F. Good Subarray
You are given an integer array a of size n.
Let's call an array good if it can be obtained using the following algorithm: create an array consisting of any single integer; and then perform the following operation an arbitrary number of times: choose an element from the already existing array (let's call it x) and add x, (xâˆ’1), or (x+1) to the end of the array.
For example, the arrays [1,2,1], [5] and [3,2,1,4] are good, while [2,4] and [3,1,2] are not.
Your task is to count the number of good contiguous subarrays of the array a. Two subarrays that have the same elements but are in different positions of the array a are considered different.
