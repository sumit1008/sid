F1. Khayyam's Royal Decree (Easy Version)

This is the easy version of the problem. The only differences between the two versions are the constraints on k and the sum of k.
In ancient Persia, Khayyam, a clever merchant and mathematician, is playing a game with his prized treasure chest containing n red rubies worth 2 dinars each and m blue sapphires worth 1 dinar each. He also has a satchel, which starts empty, and k scrolls with pairs (r1,b1),(r2,b2),â€¦,(rk,bk) that describe special conditions.
The game proceeds for n+m turns as follows:
Note that the value of some gems might be affected by multiple decrees, and in that case the gems' value is doubled multiple times.
Determine the expected value of Khayyam's satchel at the end of the game, modulo 998,244,353.
Formally, let M=998,244,353. It can be shown that the exact answer can be expressed as an irreducible fraction pq, where p and q are integers and q \not \equiv 0 \pmod{M}. Output the integer equal to p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod M. In other words, output such an integer x that 0 \le x < M and x \cdot q \equiv p \pmod{M}.
