D. Manhattan Circle
Given a n by m grid consisting of '.' and '#' characters, there exists a whole manhattan circle on the grid. The top left corner of the grid has coordinates (1,1), and the bottom right corner has coordinates (n,m).
Point (a,b) belongs to the manhattan circle centered at (h,k) if |h−a|+|k−b|<r, where r is a positive constant.
On the grid, the set of points that are part of the manhattan circle is marked as '#'. Find the coordinates of the center of the circle.
