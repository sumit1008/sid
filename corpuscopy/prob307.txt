Yes, this is another one of those constructive permutation problems.
You are given an integer 𝑛n. You have to construct a permutation 𝑝p of size 𝑛n, i. e. an array of 𝑛n integers, where every integer from 11 to 𝑛n appears exactly once.
Every pair of adjacent elements in the permutation (𝑝𝑖pi and 𝑝𝑖+1pi+1) must meet the following condition:
  - if one of them is divisible by the other, the condition 𝑝𝑖<𝑝𝑖+1pi<pi+1 must hold;
  - otherwise, the condition 𝑝𝑖>𝑝𝑖+1pi>pi+1 must hold.
