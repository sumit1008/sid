B. Battle for Survive
Eralim, being the mafia boss, manages a group of n fighters. Fighter i has a rating of ai.
Eralim arranges a tournament of n−1 battles, in each of which two not yet eliminated fighters i and j (1≤i<j≤n) are chosen, and as a result of the battle, fighter i is eliminated from the tournament, and the rating of fighter j is reduced by the rating of fighter i. That is, aj is decreased by ai. Note that fighter j's rating can become negative. The fighters indexes do not change.
Eralim wants to know what maximum rating the last remaining fighter can preserve if he chooses the battles optimally.
