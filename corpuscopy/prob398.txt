A. Find K Distinct Points with Fixed Center
You are given three integers xc, yc, and k (−100≤xc,yc≤100, 1≤k≤1000).
You need to find k distinct points (x1,y1), (x2,y2), …, (xk,yk), having integer coordinates, on the 2D coordinate plane such that:
  - their center∗ is (xc,yc)
  - −109≤xi,yi≤109 for all i from 1 to k
It can be proven that at least one set of k distinct points always exists that satisfies these conditions.
