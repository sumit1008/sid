D. Right Left Wrong
Vlad found a strip of n cells, numbered from left to right from 1 to n. In the i-th cell, there is a positive integer ai and a letter si, where all si are either 'L' or 'R'.
Vlad invites you to try to score the maximum possible points by performing any (possibly zero) number of operations.
In one operation, you can choose two indices l and r (1≤l<r≤n) such that sl = 'L' and sr = 'R' and do the following:
  - add al+al+1+⋯+ar−1+ar points to the current score;
  - replace si with '.' for all l≤i≤r, meaning you can no longer choose these indices.
For example, consider the following strip:
You can first choose l=1, r=2 and add 3+5=8 to your score.
Then choose l=3, r=6 and add 1+4+3+2=10 to your score.
As a result, it is impossible to perform another operation, and the final score is 18.
What is the maximum score that can be achieved?
