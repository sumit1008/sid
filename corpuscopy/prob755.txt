F. Rudolf and Imbalance
Rudolf has prepared a set of n problems with complexities a1<a2<a3<⋯<an. He is not entirely satisfied with the balance, so he wants to add at most one problem to fix it.
For this, Rudolf came up with m models of problems and k functions. The complexity of the i-th model is di, and the complexity of the j-th function is fj. To create a problem, he selects values i and j (1≤i≤m, 1≤j≤k) and by combining the i-th model with the j-th function, he obtains a new problem with complexity di+fj (a new element is inserted into the array a).
To determine the imbalance of the set, Rudolf sorts the complexities of the problems in ascending order and finds the largest value of ai−ai−1 (i>1).
What is the minimum value of imbalance that Rudolf can achieve by adding at most one problem, created according to the described rules?
