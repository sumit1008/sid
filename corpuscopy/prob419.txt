This is an interactive problem!
Timofey is writing a competition called Capture the Flag (or CTF for short). He has one task left, which involves hacking a security system. The entire system is based on polynomial hashesâˆ—.
Timofey can input a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters into the system, and the system will return its polynomial hash. To hack the system, Timofey needs to find the polynomial hash parameters (p and m) that the system uses.
Timofey doesn't have much time left, so he will only be able to make 3 queries. Help him solve the task.
