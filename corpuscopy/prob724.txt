C. Tree Cutting
You are given a tree with n vertices.
Your task is to find the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from this tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component† is at least x.
† Two vertices v and u are in the same connected component if there exists a sequence of numbers t1,t2,…,tk of arbitrary length k, such that t1=v, tk=u, and for each i from 1 to k−1, vertices ti and ti+1 are connected by an edge.
