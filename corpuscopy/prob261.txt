E2. Digital Village (Hard Version)
This is the hard version of the problem. In the three versions, the constraints on n and m are different. You can make hacks only if all the versions of the problem are solved.
Pak Chanek is setting up internet connections for the village of Khuntien. The village can be represented as a connected simple graph with n houses and m internet cables connecting house ui and house vi, each with a latency of wi.
There are p houses that require internet. Pak Chanek can install servers in at most k of the houses. The houses that need internet will then be connected to one of the servers. However, since each cable has its latency, the latency experienced by house si requiring internet will be the maximum latency of the cables between that house and the server it is connected to.
For each k=1,2,â€¦,n, help Pak Chanek determine the minimum total latency that can be achieved for all the houses requiring internet.
