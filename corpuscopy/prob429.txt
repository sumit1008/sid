E. Xor-Grid Problem
Given a matrix a of size n×m, each cell of which contains a non-negative integer. The integer lying at the intersection of the i-th row and the j-th column of the matrix is called ai,j.
Let's define f(i) and g(j) as the XOR of all integers in the i-th row and the j-th column, respectively. In one operation, you can either:
  - Select any row i, then assign ai,j:=g(j) for each 1≤j≤m; or
  - Select any column j, then assign ai,j:=f(i) for each 1≤i≤n.
In this example, as we apply an operation on column 2, all elements in this column are changed:
  - a1,2:=f(1)=a1,1⊕a1,2⊕a1,3⊕a1,4=1⊕1⊕1⊕1=0
  - a2,2:=f(2)=a2,1⊕a2,2⊕a2,3⊕a2,4=2⊕3⊕5⊕7=3
  - a3,2:=f(3)=a3,1⊕a3,2⊕a3,3⊕a3,4=2⊕0⊕3⊕0=1
  - a4,2:=f(4)=a4,1⊕a4,2⊕a4,3⊕a4,4=10⊕11⊕12⊕16=29
You can apply the operations any number of times. Then, we calculate the beauty of the final matrix by summing the absolute differences between all pairs of its adjacent cells.
More formally, beauty(a)=∑|ax,y−ar,c| for all cells (x,y) and (r,c) if they are adjacent. Two cells are considered adjacent if they share a side.
Find the minimum beauty among all obtainable matrices.
