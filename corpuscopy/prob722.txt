E. Girl Permutation
Some permutation of length n is guessed.
You are given the indices of its prefix maximums and suffix maximums.
Recall that a permutation of length k is an array of size k such that each integer from 1 to k occurs exactly once.
Prefix maximums are the elements that are the maximum on the prefix ending at that element. More formally, the element ai is a prefix maximum if ai>aj for every j<i.
Similarly, suffix maximums are defined, the element ai is a suffix maximum if ai>aj for every j>i.
You need to output the number of different permutations that could have been guessed.
As this number can be very large, output the answer modulo 109+7.
