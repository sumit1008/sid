E. Balanced
You are given a cyclic array a with n elements, where n is odd. In each operation, you can do the following:
  - Choose an index 1≤i≤n and increase ai−1 by 1, ai by 2, and ai+1 by 1. The element before the first element is the last element because this is a cyclic array.
A cyclic array is called balanced if all its elements are equal to each other.
Find any sequence of operations to make this cyclic array balanced or determine that it is impossible. Please note that you do not have to minimize the number of operations.
