E. Narrower Passageway
You are a strategist of The ICPC Kingdom. You received an intel that there will be monster attacks on a narrow passageway near the kingdom. The narrow passageway can be represented as a grid with 2 rows (numbered from 1 to 2) and N columns (numbered from 1 to N). Denote (r,c) as the cell in row r and column c. A soldier with a power of Pr,c is assigned to protect (r,c) every single day.
It is known that the passageway is very foggy. Within a day, each column in the passageway has a 50% chance of being covered in fog. If a column is covered in fog, the two soldiers assigned to that column are not deployed that day. Otherwise, the assigned soldiers will be deployed.
Define a connected area [u,v] (uâ‰¤v) as a maximal set of consecutive columns from u to v (inclusive) such that each column in the set is not covered in fog. The following illustration is an example of connected areas. The grayed cells are cells covered in fog. There are 4 connected areas: [1,2], [4,6], [9,9], and [11,11].
The strength of a connected area [u,v] can be calculated as follows. Let m1 and m2 be the maximum power of the soldiers in the first and second rows of the connected area, respectively. Formally, mr=max for r \in \{ 1, 2\}. If m_1 = m_2, then the strength is 0. Otherwise, the strength is \min (m_1, m_2).
The total strength of the deployment is the sum of the strengths for all connected areas. Determine the expected total strength of the deployment on any single day.
