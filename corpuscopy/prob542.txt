B. New Bakery
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob organized the following promotion:
  - Bob chooses some integer k (0≤k≤min(n,b)).
  - Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i-th (1≤i≤k) sold bun is (b−i+1) coins.
  - The remaining (n−k) buns are sold at a coins each.
Note that k can be equal to 0. In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a coins each.
Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.
