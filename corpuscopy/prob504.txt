A. Strange Splitting
Define the range of a non-empty array to be the maximum value minus the minimum value. For example, the range of [1,4,2] is 4−1=3.
You are given an array a1,a2,…,an of length n≥3. It is guaranteed a is sorted.
You have to color each element of a red or blue so that:
  - the range of the red elements does not equal the range of the blue elements, and
  - there is at least one element of each color.
If there does not exist any such coloring, you should report it. If there are multiple valid colorings, you can print any of them.
