A. King Keykhosrow's Mystery
There is a tale about the wise King Keykhosrow who owned a grand treasury filled with treasures from across the Persian Empire. However, to prevent theft and ensure the safety of his wealth, King Keykhosrow's vault was sealed with a magical lock that could only be opened by solving a riddle.
The riddle involves two sacred numbers a and b. To unlock the vault, the challenger must determine the smallest key number m that satisfies two conditions:
  - m must be greater than or equal to at least one of a and b.
  - The remainder when m is divided by a must be equal to the remainder when m is divided by b.
Only by finding the smallest correct value of m can one unlock the vault and access the legendary treasures!
