G. Bessie and Cards
Bessie has recently started playing a famous card game. In the game, there is only one deck of cards, consisting of a "draw 0" cards, b "draw 1" cards, c "draw 2" cards, and 5 special cards. At the start of the game, all cards are in the randomly shuffled deck.
Bessie starts the game by drawing the top 5 cards of the deck. She may then play "draw x" cards from the hand to draw the next x cards from the top of the deck. Note that every card can only be played once, special cards cannot be played, and if Bessie uses a "draw 2" card when there is only 1 card remaining in the deck, then she simply draws that remaining card. Bessie wins if she draws all 5 special cards.
Since Bessie is not very good at math problems, she wants you to find the probability that she wins, given that the deck is shuffled randomly over all (a+b+c+5)! possible orderings. It can be shown that this answer can always be expressed as a fraction pq where p and q are coprime integers. Output p⋅q−1 modulo 998244353.
