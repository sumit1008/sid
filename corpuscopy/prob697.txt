F. 0, 1, 2, Tree!
Find the minimum height of a rooted tree†† with a+b+c vertices that satisfies the following conditions:
  - a vertices have exactly 2 children,
  - b vertices have exactly 1 child, and
  - c vertices have exactly 0 children.
If no such tree exists, you should report it.
† A rooted tree is a connected graph without cycles, with a special vertex called the root. In a rooted tree, among any two vertices connected by an edge, one vertex is a parent (the one closer to the root), and the other one is a child.
The distance between two vertices in a tree is the number of edges in the shortest path between them. The height of a rooted tree is the maximum distance from a vertex to the root.
