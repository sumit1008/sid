B. Gorilla and the Exam
Due to a shortage of teachers in the senior class of the "T-generation", it was decided to have a huge male gorilla conduct exams for the students. However, it is not that simple; to prove his competence, he needs to solve the following problem.
For an array b, we define the function f(b) as the smallest number of the following operations required to make the array b empty:
  - take two integers l and r, such that lâ‰¤r, and let x be the min; then
  - remove all such b_i that l \le i \le r and b_i = x from the array, the deleted elements are removed, the indices are renumerated.
You are given an array a of length n and an integer k. No more than k times, you can choose any index i (1 \le i \le n) and any integer p, and replace a_i with p.
Help the gorilla to determine the smallest value of f(a) that can be achieved after such replacements.
