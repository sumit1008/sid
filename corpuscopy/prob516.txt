B. Collatz Conjecture
Recently, the first-year student Maxim learned about the Collatz conjecture, but he didn't pay much attention during the lecture, so he believes that the following process is mentioned in the conjecture:
There is a variable x and a constant y. The following operation is performed k times:
  - increase x by 1, then
  - while the number x is divisible by y, divide it by y.
Note that both of these actions are performed sequentially within one operation.
For example, if the number x=16, y=3, and k=2, then after one operation x becomes 17, and after another operation x becomes 2, because after adding one, x=18 is divisible by 3 twice.
Given the initial values of x, y, and k, Maxim wants to know what is the final value of x.
