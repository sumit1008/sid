D. Funny Game
Vanya has a graph with 𝑛n vertices (numbered from 11 to 𝑛n) and an array 𝑎a of 𝑛n integers; initially, there are no edges in the graph. Vanya got bored, and to have fun, he decided to perform 𝑛−1n−1 operations.
Operation number 𝑥x (operations are numbered in order starting from 11) is as follows:
  - Choose 22 different numbers 1≤𝑢,𝑣≤𝑛1≤u,v≤n, such that |𝑎𝑢−𝑎𝑣||au−av| is divisible by 𝑥x.
  - Add an undirected edge between vertices 𝑢u and 𝑣v to the graph.
Help Vanya get a connected∗∗ graph using the 𝑛−1n−1 operations, or determine that it is impossible.
