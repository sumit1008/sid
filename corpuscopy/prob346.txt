G. Substring Compression
Let's define the operation of compressing a string t, consisting of at least 2 digits from 1 to 9, as follows:
  - split it into an even number of non-empty substrings — let these substrings be t1,t2,…,tm (so, t=t1+t2+⋯+tm, where + is the concatenation operation);
  - write the string t2 t1 times, then the string t4 t3 times, and so on.
For example, for a string "12345", one could do the following: split it into ("1", "23", "4", "5"), and write "235555".
Let the function f(t) for a string t return the minimum length of the string that can be obtained as a result of that process.
You are given a string s, consisting of n digits from 1 to 9, and an integer k. Calculate the value of the function f for all contiguous substrings of s of length exactly k.
