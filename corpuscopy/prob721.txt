Oleg received a permutation a of length n as a birthday present.
Oleg's friend Nechipor asks Oleg q questions, each question is characterized by two numbers l and r, in response to the question Oleg must say the number of sets of indices (t1,t2,…,tk) of any length k≥1 such that:
  - l≤ti≤r for each i from 1 to k.
  - ti<ti+1 for each i from 1 to k−1.
  - ati+1 is divisible by ati for each i from 1 to k−1.
