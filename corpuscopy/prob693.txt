C. Ticket Hoarding
As the CEO of a startup company, you want to reward each of your k𝑘 employees with a ticket to the upcoming concert. The tickets will be on sale for n𝑛 days, and by some time travelling, you have predicted that the price per ticket at day i𝑖 will be ai𝑎𝑖. However, to prevent ticket hoarding, the concert organizers have implemented the following measures:
  - A person may purchase no more than m𝑚 tickets per day.
  - If a person purchases x𝑥 tickets on day i𝑖, all subsequent days (i.e. from day i+1𝑖+1 onwards) will have their prices per ticket increased by x𝑥.
For example, if a=[1,3,8,4,5]𝑎=[1,3,8,4,5] and you purchase 22 tickets on day 11, they will cost 22 in total, and the prices from day 22 onwards will become [5,10,6,7][5,10,6,7]. If you then purchase 33 more tickets on day 22, they will cost in total an additional 1515, and the prices from day 33 onwards will become [13,9,10][13,9,10].
Find the minimum spending to purchase k𝑘 tickets.
