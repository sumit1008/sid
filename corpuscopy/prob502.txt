C1. Magnitude (Easy Version)
The two versions of the problem are different. You may want to read both versions. You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.
You are given an array a of length n. Start with c=0. Then, for each i from 1 to n (in increasing order) do exactly one of the following:
  - Option 1: set c to c+ai.
  - Option 2: set c to |c+ai|, where |x| is the absolute value of x.
Let the maximum final value of c after the procedure described above be equal to k. Find k.
