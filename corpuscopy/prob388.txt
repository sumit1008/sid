E. Triple Operations
On the board Ivy wrote down all integers from l to r, inclusive.
In an operation, she does the following:
  - pick two numbers x and y on the board, erase them, and in their place write the numbers 3x and ⌊y3⌋. (Here ⌊∙⌋ denotes rounding down to the nearest integer).
What is the minimum number of operations Ivy needs to make all numbers on the board equal 0? We have a proof that this is always possible.
