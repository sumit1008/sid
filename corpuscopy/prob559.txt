E. Chain Queries
You are given a tree of n vertices numbered from 1 to n. Initially, all vertices are colored white or black.
You are asked to perform q queries:
  - "u" — toggle the color of vertex u (if it was white, change it to black and vice versa).
After each query, you should answer whether all the black vertices form a chain. That is, there exist two black vertices such that the simple path between them passes through all the black vertices and only the black vertices. Specifically, if there is only one black vertex, they form a chain. If there are no black vertices, they do not form a chain.
