J. Amanda the Amoeba
This problem has an attachment. You can use it to simulate and visualize the movements of the amoeba.
Amoeba Amanda lives inside a rectangular grid of square pixels. Her body occupies some of these pixels. Other pixels may be either free or blocked. Amanda moves across the grid using the so-called amoeboid movement. In each step of such a movement, her body first shrinks by one pixel (one pixel of the body is removed and becomes free), and then grows at a different place (one previously-free pixel is added to the body).
To prevent structural damage, Amanda's body always occupies a connected region of pixels, which means that any pair of pixels forming the body can be connected by a sequence of adjacent pixels without ever leaving the body. Two pixels are considered adjacent if they share a common side (each pixel has at most 4 neighbours). The body remains connected even during the movement, including the moment after removing a pixel and before adding another one.
Your task is to help Amanda find her way around. Given her initial position and desired final position, suggest a sequence of valid moves leading from the former to the latter.
