E1. Catch the Mole(Easy Version)
This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference is the limit on the number of queries.
This is an interactive problem.
You are given a tree of n nodes with node 1 as its root node.
There is a hidden mole in one of the nodes. To find its position, you can pick an integer x (1≤x≤n) to make an inquiry to the jury. Next, the jury will return 1 when the mole is in subtree x. Otherwise, the judge will return 0. If the judge returns 0 and the mole is not in root node 1, the mole will move to the parent node of the node it is currently on.
Use at most 300 operations to find the current node where the mole is located.
