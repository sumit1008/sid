E. Wonderful Tree!
You are given a tree with n vertices, rooted at vertex 1. The i-th vertex has an integer ai written on it.
Let L be the set of all direct children∗ of v. A tree is called wonderful, if for all vertices v where L is not empty, av≤∑u∈Lau. In one operation, you choose any vertex v and increase av by 1.
Find the minimum number of operations needed to make the given tree wonderful!
