C. Basil's Garden
There are 𝑛n flowers in a row, the 𝑖i-th of them initially has a positive height of ℎ𝑖hi meters.
Every second, the wind will blow from the left, causing the height of some flowers to decrease.
Specifically, every second, for each 𝑖i from 11 to 𝑛n, in this order, the following happens:
  - If 𝑖=𝑛i=n or ℎ𝑖>ℎ𝑖+1hi>hi+1, the value of ℎ𝑖hi changes to max(0,ℎ𝑖−1)max(0,hi−1).
How many seconds will pass before ℎ𝑖=0hi=0 for all 1≤𝑖≤𝑛1≤i≤n for the first time?
