G. Clacking Balls
There are m baskets placed along a circle, numbered from 1 to m in clockwise order (basket m is next to basket 1). Furthermore, there are n balls, where ball i is initially placed in basket ai, and no basket contains more than one ball.
Alice is allowed to perform the following operation, which always takes exactly one second whether you move/throw a ball or not:
  - Alice chooses an integer i between 1 and n uniformly at random.
  - If ball i was thrown away before, do nothing.
  - Otherwise, ball i is moved from the basket currently containing it to the next basket (in clockwise order). If the target basket currently contains another ball j, throw ball j away.
She repeats this operation until there is exactly one ball left. Calculate the expected time needed (in seconds) for Alice to end the process.
It can be proven that the answer can be represented as a rational number pq with coprime p and q. You need to output p⋅q−1mod109+7. It can be proven that 109+7∤.
