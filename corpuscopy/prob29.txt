Iris looked at the stars and a beautiful problem emerged in her mind. She is inviting you to solve it so that a meteor shower is believed to form.
There are 𝑛n stars in the sky, arranged in a row. Iris has a telescope, which she uses to look at the stars.
Initially, Iris observes stars in the segment [1,𝑛][1,n], and she has a lucky value of 00. Iris wants to look for the star in the middle position for each segment [𝑙,𝑟][l,r] that she observes. So the following recursive procedure is used:
  - First, she will calculate 𝑚=⌊𝑙+𝑟2⌋m=⌊l+r2⌋.
  - If the length of the segment (i.e. 𝑟−𝑙+1r−l+1) is even, Iris will divide it into two equally long segments [𝑙,𝑚][l,m] and [𝑚+1,𝑟][m+1,r] for further observation.
  - Otherwise, Iris will aim the telescope at star 𝑚m, and her lucky value will increase by 𝑚m; subsequently, if 𝑙≠𝑟l≠r, Iris will continue to observe two segments [𝑙,𝑚−1][l,m−1] and [𝑚+1,𝑟][m+1,r].
Iris is a bit lazy. She defines her laziness by an integer 𝑘k: as the observation progresses, she will not continue to observe any segment [𝑙,𝑟][l,r] with a length strictly less than 𝑘k. In this case, please predict her final lucky value.
