G3. Yunli's Subarray Queries (extreme version)
This is the extreme version of the problem. In this version, the output of each query is different from the easy and hard versions. It is also guaranteed that r≥l+k−1 for all queries.
For an arbitrary array b, Yunli can perform the following operation any number of times:
  - Select an index i. Set bi=x where x is any integer she desires (x is not limited to the interval [1,n]).
Denote f(b) as the minimum number of operations she needs to perform until there exists a consecutive subarray∗ of length at least k in b.
Yunli is given an array a of size n and asks you q queries. In each query, you must output ∑r−k+1i=l∑rj=i+k−1f([ai,ai+1,…,aj]).
