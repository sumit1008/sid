C. Bitwise Balancing
You are given three non-negative integers b, c, and d.
Please find a non-negative integer a∈[0,261] such that (a|b)−(a&c)=d, where | and & denote the bitwise OR operation and the bitwise AND operation, respectively.
If such an a exists, print its value. If there is no solution, print a single integer −1. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.
