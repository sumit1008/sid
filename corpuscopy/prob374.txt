C. Guess The Tree
This is an interactive problem.
Misuki has chosen a secret tree with n𝑛 nodes, indexed from 11 to n𝑛, and asked you to guess it by using queries of the following type:
  - "? a b" — Misuki will tell you which node x𝑥 minimizes |d(a,x)−d(b,x)|, where d(x,y) is the distance between nodes x and y. If more than one such node exists, Misuki will tell you the one which minimizes d(a,x).
Find out the structure of Misuki's secret tree using at most 15n queries!
