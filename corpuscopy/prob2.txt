G. Secret Message
Every Saturday, Alexander B., a teacher of parallel X, writes a secret message to Alexander G., a teacher of parallel B, in the evening. Since Alexander G. is giving a lecture at that time and the message is very important, Alexander B. has to write this message on an interactive online board.
The interactive online board is a grid consisting of n rows and m columns, where each cell is 1×1 in size. Some cells of this board are already filled in, and it is impossible to write a message in them; such cells are marked with the symbol ".", while the remaining cells are called free and are marked with the symbol "#".
Let us introduce two characteristics of the online board:
  - s is the number of free cells.
  - p is the perimeter of the grid figure formed by the union of free cells.
Let A be the set of free cells. Your goal is to find a set of cells S⊆A that satisfies the following properties:
  - |S|≤15⋅(s+p).
  - Any cell from A either lies in S or shares a side with some cell from S.
We can show that at least one set S satisfying these properties exists; you are required to find any suitable one.
