A. Make All Equal
You are given a cyclic array a1,a2,…,an.
You can perform the following operation on a at most n−1 times:
  - Let m be the current size of a, you can choose any two adjacent elements where the previous one is no greater than the latter one (In particular, am and a1 are adjacent and am is the previous one), and delete exactly one of them. In other words, choose an integer i (1≤i≤m) where ai≤a(imodm)+1 holds, and delete exactly one of ai or a(imodm)+1 from a.
Your goal is to find the minimum number of operations needed to make all elements in a equal.
