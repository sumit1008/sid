G. Variable Damage
Monocarp is gathering an army to fight a dragon in a videogame.
The army consists of two parts: the heroes and the defensive artifacts. Each hero has one parameter — his health. Each defensive artifact also has one parameter — its durability.
Before the battle begins, Monocarp distributes artifacts to the heroes so that each hero receives at most one artifact.
The battle consists of rounds that proceed as follows:
  - first, the dragon deals damage equal to 1a+b (a real number without rounding) to each hero, where a is the number of heroes alive and b is the number of active artifacts;
  - after that, all heroes with health 0 or less die;
  - finally, some artifacts are deactivated. An artifact with durability x is deactivated when one of the following occurs: the hero holding the artifact either dies or receives x total damage (from the start of the battle). If an artifact is not held by any hero, it is inactive from the beginning of the battle.
The battle ends when there are no heroes left alive.
Initially, the army is empty. There are q queries: add a hero with health x or an artifact with durability y to the army. After each query, determine the maximum number of rounds that Monocarp can survive if he distributes the artifacts optimally.
