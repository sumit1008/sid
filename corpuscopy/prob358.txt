C. Turtle and Good Pairs
Turtle gives you a string s, consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
Turtle considers a pair of integers (i,j) (1≤i<j≤n) to be a pleasant pair if and only if there exists an integer k such that i≤k<j and both of the following two conditions hold:
  - sk≠sk+1;
  - sk≠si or sk+1≠sj.
Besides, Turtle considers a pair of integers (i,j) (1≤i<j≤n) to be a good pair if and only if si=sj or (i,j) is a pleasant pair.
Turtle wants to reorder the string s so that the number of good pairs is maximized. Please help him!
