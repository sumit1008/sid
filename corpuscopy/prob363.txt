F2. Court Blue (Hard Version)
This is the hard version of the problem. In this version, it is not guaranteed that n=m, and the time limit is higher. You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved.
In the court of the Blue King, Lelle and Flamm are having a performance match. The match consists of several rounds. In each round, either Lelle or Flamm wins.
Let WL and WF denote the number of wins of Lelle and Flamm, respectively. The Blue King considers a match to be successful if and only if:
  - after every round, gcd(WL,WF)≤1;
  - at the end of the match, WL≤n,WF≤m.
Note that gcd(0,x)=gcd(x,0)=x for every non-negative integer x.
Lelle and Flamm can decide to stop the match whenever they want, and the final score of the performance is l⋅WL+f⋅WF.
Please help Lelle and Flamm coordinate their wins and losses such that the performance is successful, and the total score of the performance is maximized.
