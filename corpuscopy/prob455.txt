B. Array Craft
For an array b of size m, we define:
  - the maximum prefix position of b is the smallest index i that satisfies b1+…+bi=maxmj=1(b1+…+bj);
  - the maximum suffix position of b is the largest index i that satisfies bi+…+bm=maxmj=1(bj+…+bm).
You are given three integers n, x, and y (x>y). Construct an array a of size n satisfying:
  - ai is either 1 or −1 for all 1≤i≤n;
  - the maximum prefix position of a is x;
  - the maximum suffix position of a is y.
If there are multiple arrays that meet the conditions, print any. It can be proven that such an array always exists under the given conditions.
