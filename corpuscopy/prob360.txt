A. Turtle and Good Strings
Turtle thinks a string s is a good string if there exists a sequence of strings t1,t2,…,tk (k is an arbitrary integer) such that:
  - k≥2.
  - s=t1+t2+…+tk, where + represents the concatenation operation. For example, abc=a+bc.
  - For all 1≤i<j≤k, the first character of ti isn't equal to the last character of tj.
Turtle is given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin letters. Please tell him whether the string s is a good string!
