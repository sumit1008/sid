F. Penchick and Even Medians

This is an interactive problem.
Returning from a restful vacation on Australia's Gold Coast, Penchick forgot to bring home gifts for his pet duck Duong Canh! But perhaps a beautiful problem crafted through deep thought on the scenic beaches could be the perfect souvenir.
There is a hidden permutation∗ p of length n, where n is even. You are allowed to make the following query:
  - Choose a subsequence† of the permutation p with even length 4≤k≤n. The interactor will return the value of the two medians‡ in the chosen subsequence.
Find the index of the two medians in permutation p using at most 80 queries.
Note that the interactor is non-adaptive. This means that the permutation p is fixed at the beginning and will not change based on your queries.
