E. Rudolf and k Bridges
Bernard loves visiting Rudolf, but he is always running late. The problem is that Bernard has to cross the river on a ferry. Rudolf decided to help his friend solve this problem.
The river is a grid of 𝑛n rows and 𝑚m columns. The intersection of the 𝑖i-th row and the 𝑗j-th column contains the number 𝑎𝑖,𝑗ai,j — the depth in the corresponding cell. All cells in the first and last columns correspond to the river banks, so the depth for them is 00.
Rudolf can choose the row (𝑖,1),(𝑖,2),…,(𝑖,𝑚)(i,1),(i,2),…,(i,m) and build a bridge over it. In each cell of the row, he can install a support for the bridge. The cost of installing a support in the cell (𝑖,𝑗)(i,j) is 𝑎𝑖,𝑗+1ai,j+1. Supports must be installed so that the following conditions are met:
Building just one bridge is boring. Therefore, Rudolf decided to build 𝑘k bridges on consecutive rows of the river, that is, to choose some 𝑖i (1≤𝑖≤𝑛−𝑘+11≤i≤n−k+1) and independently build a bridge on each of the rows 𝑖,𝑖+1,…,𝑖+𝑘−1i,i+1,…,i+k−1. Help Rudolf minimize the total cost of installing supports.
