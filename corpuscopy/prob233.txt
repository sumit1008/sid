E. Best Subsequence
Given an integer array a of size n.
Let's define the value of the array as its size minus the number of set bits in the bitwise OR of all elements of the array.
For example, for the array [1,0,1,2], the bitwise OR is 3 (which contains 2 set bits), and the value of the array is 4âˆ’2=2.
Your task is to calculate the maximum possible value of some subsequence of the given array.
