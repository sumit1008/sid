H. Sakurako's Test
Sakurako will soon take a test. The test can be described as an array of integers n and a task on it:
Given an integer x, Sakurako can perform the following operation any number of times:
  - Choose an integer i (1≤i≤n) such that ai≥x;
  - Change the value of ai to ai−x.
Using this operation any number of times, she must find the minimum possible median∗ of the array a.
Sakurako knows the array but does not know the integer x. Someone let it slip that one of the q values of x will be in the next test, so Sakurako is asking you what the answer is for each such x.
