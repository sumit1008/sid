M. Royal Flush
Consider the following game. There is a deck, which consists of cards of n different suits. For each suit, there are 13 cards in the deck, all with different ranks (the ranks are 2, 3, 4, ..., 10, Jack, Queen, King and Ace).
Initially, the deck is shuffled randomly (all (13n)! possible orders of cards have the same probability). You draw 5 topmost cards from the deck. Then, every turn of the game, the following events happen, in the given order:
Your goal is to find a strategy that allows you to win in the minimum expected number of turns. Note that the turn when the game ends is not counted (for example, if the 5 cards you draw initially already form a Royal Flush, you win in 0 turns).
Calculate the minimum possible expected number of turns required to win the game.
