F. Formation
One day, the teachers of "T-generation" decided to instill discipline in the pupils, so they lined them up and made them calculate in order. There are a total of n pupils, the height of the i-th pupil in line is ai.
The line is comfortable, if for each i from 1 to n−1, the following condition holds: ai⋅2≥ai+1. Initially, the line is comfortable.
The teachers do not like that the maximum height in the line is too small, so they want to feed the pupils pizza. You know that when a pupil eats one pizza, their height increases by 1. One pizza can only be eaten by only one pupil, but each pupil can eat an unlimited number of pizzas. It is important that after all the pupils have eaten their pizzas, the line is comfortable.
The teachers have q options for how many pizzas they will order. For each option ki, answer the question: what is the maximum height max that can be achieved if the pupils eat at most k_i pizzas.
