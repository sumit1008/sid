C. Squaring
ikrpprpp found an array a consisting of integers. He likes justice, so he wants to make a fair — that is, make it non-decreasing. To do that, he can perform an act of justice on an index 1≤i≤n of the array, which will replace ai with a2i (the element at position i with its square). For example, if a=[2,4,3,3,5,3] and ikrpprpp chooses to perform an act of justice on i=4, a becomes [2,4,3,9,5,3].
What is the minimum number of acts of justice needed to make the array non-decreasing?
