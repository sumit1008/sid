A. Diagonals
Vitaly503 is given a checkered board with a side of n and k chips. He realized that all these k chips need to be placed on the cells of the board (no more than one chip can be placed on a single cell).
Let's denote the cell in the i-th row and j-th column as (i,j). A diagonal is the set of cells for which the value i+j is the same. For example, cells (3,1), (2,2), and (1,3) lie on the same diagonal, but (1,2) and (2,3) do not. A diagonal is called occupied if it contains at least one chip.
Determine what is the minimum possible number of occupied diagonals among all placements of k chips.
