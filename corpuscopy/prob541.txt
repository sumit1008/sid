C. Manhattan Permutations
Let's call the Manhattan value of a permutation†† p the value of the expression |p1−1|+|p2−2|+…+|pn−n|.
For example, for the permutation [1,2,3], the Manhattan value is |1−1|+|2−2|+|3−3|=0, and for the permutation [3,1,2], the Manhattan value is |3−1|+|1−2|+|2−3|=2+1+1=4.
You are given integers n and k. Find a permutation p of length n such that its Manhattan value is equal to k, or determine that no such permutation exists.
†A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).
