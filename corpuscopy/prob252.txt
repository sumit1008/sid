A. Concatenation of Arrays
You are given n arrays a1, …, an. The length of each array is two. Thus, ai=[ai,1,ai,2]. You need to concatenate the arrays into a single array of length 2n such that the number of inversions† in the resulting array is minimized. Note that you do not need to count the actual number of inversions.
More formally, you need to choose a permutation‡ p of length n, so that the array b=[ap1,1,ap1,2,ap2,1,ap2,2,…,apn,1,apn,2] contains as few inversions as possible.
†The number of inversions in an array c is the number of pairs of indices i and j such that i<j and ci>cj.
‡A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).
