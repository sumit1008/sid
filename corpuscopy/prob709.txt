E. Damage per Second
You just created a new character in your favourite role-playing game and now have to decide how to skill him.
The two skill attributes to be chosen are: damage per hit and hits per second. Damage per hit is the amount of damage you deal with a single hit, while hits per second is the number of hits you can make in one second. Initially, both skill attributes are set at 00. You have k skill points to distribute as you want; in other words, you can choose the values of the two skills so that they are positive integers with sum at most k.
The tutorial of the game (the boring part you want to finish as soon as possible) consists of n monsters to be killed one after the other. The i-th monster has hi health points, i.e., it dies after you have inflicted at least hi damage.
How can you assign the two skill attributes to minimize the time necessary to kill all the n monsters?
