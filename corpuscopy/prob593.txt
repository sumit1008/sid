E3. Trails (Hard)
Harry Potter is hiking in the Alps surrounding Lake Geneva. In this area there are m cabins, numbered 1 to m. Each cabin is connected, with one or more trails, to a central meeting point next to the lake. Each trail is either short or long. Cabin i is connected with si short trails and li long trails to the lake.
Each day, Harry walks a trail from the cabin where he currently is to Lake Geneva, and then from there he walks a trail to any of the m cabins (including the one he started in). However, as he has to finish the hike in a day, at least one of the two trails has to be short.
How many possible combinations of trails can Harry take if he starts in cabin 1 and walks for n days?
Give the answer modulo 109+7.
