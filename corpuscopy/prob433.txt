A. Question Marks
Tim is doing a test consisting of 4n questions; each question has 4 options: 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'D'. For each option, there are exactly n correct answers corresponding to that option â€” meaning there are n questions with the answer 'A', n questions with the answer 'B', n questions with the answer 'C', and n questions with the answer 'D'.
For each question, Tim wrote his answer on the answer sheet. If he could not figure out the answer, he would leave a question mark '?' for that question.
You are given his answer sheet of 4n characters. What is the maximum number of correct answers Tim can get?
