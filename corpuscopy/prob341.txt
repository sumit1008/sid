D. Alter the GCD
You are given two arrays a1,a2,…,an and b1,b2,…,bn.
You must perform the following operation exactly once:
  - choose any indices l and r such that 1≤l≤r≤n;
  - swap ai and bi for all i such that l≤i≤r.
Find the maximum possible value of gcd(a1,a2,…,an)+gcd(b1,b2,…,bn) after performing the operation exactly once. Also find the number of distinct pairs (l,r) which achieve the maximum value.
