H. Counting 101
It's been a long summer's day, with the constant chirping of cicadas and the heat which never seemed to end. Finally, it has drawn to a close. The showdown has passed, the gates are open, and only a gentle breeze is left behind.
Your predecessors had taken their final bow; it's your turn to take the stage.
Sorting through some notes that were left behind, you found a curious statement named Problem 101:
  - Given a positive integer sequence a1,a2,â€¦,an, you can operate on it any number of times. In an operation, you choose three consecutive elements ai,ai+1,ai+2, and merge them into one element max. Please calculate the maximum number of operations you can do without creating an element greater than m.
After some thought, you decided to propose the following problem, named Counting 101:
  - Given n and m. For each k=0,1,\ldots,\left\lfloor\frac{n-1}{2}\right\rfloor, please find the number of integer sequences a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n with elements in [1, m], such that when used as input for Problem 101, the answer is k. As the answer can be very large, please print it modulo 10^9+7.
