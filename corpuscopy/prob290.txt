C. Robin Hood in Town
Look around, the rich are getting richer, and the poor are getting poorer. We need to take from the rich and give to the poor. We need Robin Hood!
There are n people living in the town. Just now, the wealth of the i-th person was ai gold. But guess what? The richest person has found an extra pot of gold!
More formally, find an aj=max(a1,a2,…,an), change aj to aj+x, where x is a non-negative integer number of gold found in the pot. If there are multiple maxima, it can be any one of them.
A person is unhappy if their wealth is strictly less than half of the average wealth∗.
If strictly more than half of the total population n are unhappy, Robin Hood will appear by popular demand.
Determine the minimum value of x for Robin Hood to appear, or output −1 if it is impossible.
