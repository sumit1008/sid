F. Number of Cubes
Consider a rectangular parallelepiped with sides a, b, and c, that consists of unit cubes of k different colors. We can apply cyclic shifts to the parallelepiped in any of the three directions any number of times∗.
There are di cubes of the i-th color (1≤i≤k). How many different parallelepipeds (with the given sides) can be formed from these cubes, no two of which can be made equal by some combination of cyclic shifts?
