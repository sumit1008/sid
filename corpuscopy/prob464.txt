E. Range Minimum Sum
For an array [a1,a2,…,an] of length n, define f(a) as the sum of the minimum element over all subsegments. That is, f(a)=n∑l=1n∑r=lminl≤i≤rai.
A permutation is a sequence of integers from 1 to n of length n containing each number exactly once. You are given a permutation [a1,a2,…,an]. For each i, solve the following problem independently:
  - Erase ai from a, concatenating the remaining parts, resulting in b=[a1,a2,…,ai−1,ai+1,…,an].
  - Calculate f(b).
