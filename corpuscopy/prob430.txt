Given two positive integers n and k, and another array a of n integers.
In one operation, you can select any subarray of size k of a, then remove it from the array without changing the order of other elements. More formally, let (l,r) be an operation on subarray al,al+1,…,ar such that r−l+1=k, then performing this operation means replacing a with [a1,…,al−1,ar+1,…,an].
For example, if a=[1,2,3,4,5] and we perform operation (3,5) on this array, it will become a=[1,2]. Moreover, operation (2,4) results in a=[1,5], and operation (1,3) results in a=[4,5].
You have to repeat the operation while the length of a is greater than k (which means |a|>k). What is the largest possible median† of all remaining elements of the array a after the process?
†The median of an array of length n is the element whose index is ⌊(n+1)/2⌋ after we sort the elements in non-decreasing order. For example: median([2,1,5,4,3])=3, median([5])=5, and median([6,8,2,4])=4.
