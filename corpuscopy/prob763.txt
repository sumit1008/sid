F. Grand Finale: Circles
You are given 𝑛n circles on the plane. The 𝑖i-th of these circles is given by a tuple of integers (𝑥𝑖,𝑦𝑖,𝑟𝑖)(xi,yi,ri), where (𝑥𝑖,𝑦𝑖)(xi,yi) are the coordinates of its center, and 𝑟𝑖ri is the radius of the circle.
Please find a circle 𝐶C which meets the following conditions:
  - 𝐶C is contained inside all 𝑛n circles given in the input.
  - Among all circles 𝐶C that meet the first condition, the radius of the circle is maximum.
Let the largest suitable circle have the radius of 𝑎a.
Your output 𝐶C, described as (𝑥,𝑦,𝑟)(x,y,r), will be accepted if it meets the following conditions:
  - For each 𝑖i, (𝑥𝑖−𝑥)2+(𝑦𝑖−𝑦)2‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾√+𝑟≤𝑟𝑖+max(𝑎,1)⋅10−7(xi−x)2+(yi−y)2+r≤ri+max(a,1)⋅10−7.
  - The absolute or relative error of 𝑟r does not exceed 10−710−7. Formally, your answer is accepted if and only if |𝑟−𝑎|max(1,𝑎)≤10−7|r−a|max(1,a)≤10−7.
