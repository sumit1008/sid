D. Attribute Checks
Imagine a game where you play as a character that has two attributes: "Strength" and "Intelligence", that are at zero level initially.
During the game, you'll acquire m𝑚 attribute points that allow you to increase your attribute levels — one point will increase one of the attributes by one level. But sometimes, you'll encounter a so-called "Attribute Checks": if your corresponding attribute is high enough, you'll pass it; otherwise, you'll fail it.
Spending some time, you finally prepared a list which contains records of all points you got and all checks you've met. And now you're wondering: what is the maximum number of attribute checks you can pass in a single run if you'd spend points wisely?
Note that you can't change the order of records.
