You want to plant trees in a square lawn of size n√ón whose corners have Cartesian coordinates (0,0), (n,0), (0,n), and (n,n). Trees can only be planted at locations with integer coordinates. Every tree will grow roots within a disk of radius r centered at the location where the tree was planted; such disks must be fully contained in the lawn (possibly touching the boundary of the lawn) and can only intersect each other on their boundaries.
Find a configuration that maximizes the number of trees.
