F. Unique Strings
Let's say that two strings 𝑎a and 𝑏b are equal if you can get the string 𝑏b by cyclically shifting string 𝑎a. For example, the strings 0100110 and 1100100 are equal, while 1010 and 1100 are not.
You are given a binary string 𝑠s of length 𝑛n. Its first 𝑐c characters are 1-s, and its last 𝑛−𝑐n−c characters are 0-s.
In one operation, you can replace one 0 with 1.
Calculate the number of unique strings you can get using no more than 𝑘k operations. Since the answer may be too large, print it modulo 109+7109+7.
