D. Sakurako's Hobby
For a certain permutation p∗ Sakurako calls an integer j reachable from an integer i if it is possible to make i equal to j by assigning i=pi a certain number of times.
If p=[3,5,6,1,2,4], then, for example, 4 is reachable from 1, because: i=1 → i=p1=3 → i=p3=6 → i=p6=4. Now i=4, so 4 is reachable from 1.
Each number in the permutation is colored either black or white.
Sakurako defines the function F(i) as the number of black integers that are reachable from i.
Sakurako is interested in F(i) for each 1≤i≤n, but calculating all values becomes very difficult, so she asks you, as her good friend, to compute this.
