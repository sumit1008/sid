B. Scale
Tina has a square grid with n rows and n columns. Each cell in the grid is either 0 or 1.
Tina wants to reduce the grid by a factor of k (k is a divisor of n). To do this, Tina splits the grid into k√ók nonoverlapping blocks of cells such that every cell belongs to exactly one block.
Tina then replaces each block of cells with a single cell equal to the value of the cells in the block. It is guaranteed that every cell in the same block has the same value.
For example, the following demonstration shows a grid being reduced by factor of 3.
Help Tina reduce the grid by a factor of k.
