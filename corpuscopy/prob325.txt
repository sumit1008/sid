E. Alternating String
Sakurako really loves alternating strings. She calls a string s of lowercase Latin letters an alternating string if characters in the even positions are the same, if characters in the odd positions are the same, and the length of the string is even.
For example, the strings 'abab' and 'gg' are alternating, while the strings 'aba' and 'ggwp' are not.

Since you are in a hurry, you need to determine the minimum number of operations required to make the string an alternating one.
