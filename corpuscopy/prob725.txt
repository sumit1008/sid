B. Maximum Sum
You have an array a of n integers.
You perform exactly k operations on it. In one operation, you select any contiguous subarray of the array a (possibly empty) and insert the sum of this subarray anywhere in the array.
Your task is to find the maximum possible sum of the array after k such operations.
As this number can be very large, output the answer modulo 109+7.
Reminder: the remainder of a number x modulo p is the smallest non-negative y such that there exists an integer q and x=pâ‹…q+y.
