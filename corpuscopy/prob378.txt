G. Call During the Journey
You live in a city consisting of n intersections and m streets connecting some pairs of intersections. You can travel in either direction on each street. No two streets connect the same pair of intersections, and no street connects an intersection to itself. You can reach any intersection from any other, possibly passing through some other intersections.
Every minute, you can board a bus at intersection ui and travel for li1 minutes to intersection vi. Conversely, you can travel from intersection vi to intersection ui in li1 minutes. You can only board and exit the bus at intersections. You can only board the bus at an intersection if you are currently there.
You can also walk along each street, which takes li2>li1 minutes.
You can make stops at intersections.
You live at intersection number 1. Today you woke up at time 0, and you have an important event scheduled at intersection number n, which you must reach no later than time t0. You also have a phone call planned that will last from t1 to t2 minutes (t1<t2<t0).
During the phone call, you cannot ride the bus, but you can walk along any streets, make stops, or stay at home. You can exit the bus at minute t1 and board the bus again at minute t2.
Since you want to get enough sleep, you became curious â€” how late can you leave home to have time to talk on the phone and still not be late for the event?
