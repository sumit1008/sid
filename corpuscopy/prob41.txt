D. Counting Pairs
You are given a sequence $$$a$$$, consisting of $$$n$$$ integers, where the $$$i$$$-th element of the sequence is equal to $$$a_i$$$. You are also given two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ ($$$x \le y$$$).
A pair of integers $$$(i, j)$$$ is considered interesting if the following conditions are met:
  - $$$1 \le i < j \le n$$$;
  - if you simultaneously remove the elements at positions $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ from the sequence $$$a$$$, the sum of the remaining elements is at least $$$x$$$ and at most $$$y$$$.
Your task is to determine the number of interesting pairs of integers for the given sequence $$$a$$$.
