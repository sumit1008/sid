G1. Division + LCP (easy version)
This is the easy version of the problem. In this version l=r.
You are given a string s. For a fixed k, consider a division of s into exactly k continuous substrings w1,…,wk. Let fk be the maximal possible LCP(w1,…,wk) among all divisions.
LCP(w1,…,wm) is the length of the Longest Common Prefix of the strings w1,…,wm.
For example, if s=abababcab and k=4, a possible division is abababcab. The LCP(ab,ab,abc,ab) is 2, since ab is the Longest Common Prefix of those four strings. Note that each substring consists of a continuous segment of characters and each character belongs to exactly one substring.
Your task is to find fl,fl+1,…,fr. In this version l=r.
