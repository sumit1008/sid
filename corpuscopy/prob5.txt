D. Gifts Order
"T-Generation" has decided to purchase gifts for various needs; thus, they have n different sweaters numbered from 1 to n. The i-th sweater has a size of ai. Now they need to send some subsegment of sweaters to an olympiad. It is necessary that the sweaters fit as many people as possible, but without having to take too many of them.
They need to choose two indices l and r (1≤l≤r≤n) to maximize the convenience equal to max(al,al+1,…,ar)−min(al,al+1,…,ar)−(r−l), that is, the range of sizes minus the number of sweaters.
Sometimes the sizes of the sweaters change; it is known that there have been q changes, in each change, the size of the p-th sweater becomes x.
Help the "T-Generation" team and determine the maximum convenience among all possible pairs (l,r) initially, as well as after each size change.
