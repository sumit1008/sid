E. Expected Power
You are given an array of n integers a1,a2,…,an. You are also given an array p1,p2,…,pn.
Let S denote the random multiset (i. e., it may contain equal elements) constructed as follows:
  - Initially, S is empty.
  - For each i from 1 to n, insert ai into S with probability pi104. Note that each element is inserted independently.
Denote f(S) as the bitwise XOR of all elements of S. Please calculate the expected value of (f(S))2. Output the answer modulo 109+7.
Formally, let M=109+7. It can be shown that the answer can be expressed as an irreducible fraction pq, where p and q are integers and q≢0(modM). Output the integer equal to p⋅q−1mod. In other words, output such an integer x that 0 \le x < M and x \cdot q \equiv p \pmod{M}.
