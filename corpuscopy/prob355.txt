E1. Turtle and Inversions (Easy Version)
This is an easy version of this problem. The differences between the versions are the constraint on m and ri<li+1 holds for each i from 1 to m−1 in the easy version. You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved.
Turtle gives you m intervals [l1,r1],[l2,r2],…,[lm,rm]. He thinks that a permutation p is interesting if there exists an integer ki for every interval (li≤ki<ri), and if he lets ai=kimaxj=lipj,bi=riminj=ki+1pj for every integer i from 1 to m, the following condition holds:
mmaxi=1ai<mmini=1bi
Turtle wants you to calculate the maximum number of inversions of all interesting permutations of length n, or tell him if there is no interesting permutation.
An inversion of a permutation p is a pair of integers (i,j) (1≤i<j≤n) such that pi>pj.
