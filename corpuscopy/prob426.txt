A. Diverse Game
Petr, watching Sergey's stream, came up with a matrix a, consisting of n rows and m columns (the number in the i-th row and j-th column is denoted as ai,j), which contains all integers from 1 to n⋅m. But he didn't like the arrangement of the numbers, and now he wants to come up with a new matrix b, consisting of n rows and m columns, which will also contain all integers from 1 to n⋅m, such that for any 1≤i≤n,1≤j≤m it holds that ai,j≠bi,j.
You are given the matrix a, construct any matrix b that meets Petr's requirements, or determine that it is impossible.
Hurry up! Otherwise, he will donate all his money to the stream in search of an answer to his question.
