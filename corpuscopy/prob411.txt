A. Legs
It's another beautiful day on Farmer John's farm.
After Farmer John arrived at his farm, he counted 𝑛n legs. It is known only chickens and cows live on the farm, and a chicken has 22 legs while a cow has 44.
What is the minimum number of animals Farmer John can have on his farm assuming he counted the legs of all animals?
