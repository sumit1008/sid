G2. Ruler (hard version)
This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two versions is that in this version, you can make at most 77 queries.
This is an interactive problem. If you are unsure how interactive problems work, then it is recommended to read the guide for participants.
We have a secret ruler that is missing one number x (2≤x≤999). When you measure an object of length y, the ruler reports the following values:
  - If y<x, the ruler (correctly) measures the object as having length y.
  - If y≥x, the ruler incorrectly measures the object as having length y+1.
You need to find the value of x. To do that, you can make queries of the following form:
  - ? a b — in response, we will measure the side lengths of an a×b rectangle with our ruler and multiply the results, reporting the measured area of the rectangle back to you. For example, if x=4 and you query a 3×5 rectangle, we will measure its side lengths as 3×6 and report 18 back to you.
Find the value of x. You can ask at most 7 queries.
