H. Composite Spells
Monocarp plays a fantasy RPG. His character is a mage, so he casts spells. There are two types of spells he knows â€” basic spells and composite spells.
There are n basic spells in Monocarp's spell book, numbered from 1 to n. Each basic spell simply changes the health of the target: either decreases it or increases it. The i-th basic spell changes the target's health value by bi (increases by bi if bi is non-negative, or decreases by |bi| if bi is negative). If the target's health value goes to 0 or below, it dies, and all next spells cast at it do nothing.
There are also m composite spells in the spell book, numbered from n+1 to n+m. Each composite spell is a sequence of other spells, cast in specific order. A composite spell can consist both of basic spells and composite spells; the i-th spell consists of si other spells, and each of those spells has index strictly less than i (so there is no situation that composite spells infinitely cast each other). So, actually, each composite spell can be considered a finite sequence of basic spells, although its length might be huge. Note that the same spell can appear in a composite spell multiple times.
Monocarp has decided to cast the (n+m)-th spell from his spell book. The target of this spell is a monster with an initial health value of hp. Monocarp wants to know whether the monster will be killed or not, and if it will be killed, which basic spell will kill it.
