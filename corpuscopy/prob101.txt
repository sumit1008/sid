F. Nim
Recall the rules of the game "Nim". There are n piles of stones, where the i-th pile initially contains some number of stones. Two players take turns choosing a non-empty pile and removing any positive (strictly greater than 0) number of stones from it. The player unable to make a move loses the game.
You are given an array a, consisting of n integers. Artem and Ruslan decided to play Nim on segments of this array. Each of the q rounds is defined by a segment (li,ri), where the elements ali,ali+1,…,ari represent the sizes of the piles of stones.
Before the game starts, Ruslan can remove any number of piles from the chosen segment. However, at least one pile must remain, so in a single round he can remove at most (ri−li) piles. He is allowed to remove 0 piles. After the removal, the game is played on the remaining piles within the segment.
All rounds are independent: the changes made in one round do not affect the original array or any other rounds.
Ruslan wants to remove as many piles as possible so that Artem, who always makes the first move, loses.
For each round, determine:
Two ways are considered different if there exists an index i such that the pile at index i is removed in one way but not in the other. Since the number of ways can be large, output it modulo 998244353.
If Ruslan cannot ensure Artem's loss in a particular round, output -1 for that round.
