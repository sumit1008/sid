B. Make It Equal
You are given an integer array a of size n. The elements of the array are numbered from 1 to n.
You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly, zero): choose an index i from 1 to n; decrease ai by 2 and increase a(imodn)+1 by 1.
After you perform the operations, all elements of the array should be non-negative equal integers.
Your task is to calculate the minimum number of operations you have to perform.
